<h2><a name="ch1-1" id="ch1-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">GABRIELLE SILVESTER WRITES A LETTER</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle returned from the Town Hall where the
meeting was held, just after ten o&#39;clock, and was glad
to see the fire burning brightly in her room. She
remembered that she would never have thought of
such a luxury as a fire in her bedroom prior to her
visit to New York.</p>

<p class="indent">All agreed that it had been a very successful meeting,
and that real, convincing work had been done.
She herself could say, in the privacy of her own room,
that the excitements of such gatherings had become
a necessity to her since the strenuous days in America,
and perhaps to her father also.</p>

<p class="indent">How changed her life since she first set foot on the
deck of the <i>Oceanic</i> and began to know a wider
world! England had seemed but a garden upon her
return and its people but half awake. She had a vivid
memory of the rush and roar of distant cities, of
strange faces and new races, but chiefly of a discovery
of self which at once frightened and perplexed her.</p>

<p class="indent">Would it be possible to accept without complaint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
the even tenor of that obscure life in Hampstead
which she had suffered willingly but seven months
ago? She knew that it would not, and could answer
for her father also. A call had come to him and to
her. She had been sure of it at the meeting, but of
its nature she had yet to be wholly convinced.</p>

<p class="indent">Gordon Silvester, the most eloquent preacher among
the Congregationalists, had gone to America at the
bidding of a famous millionaire, there to bear witness
to the brotherhood of man and the bond between the
peoples. The achievement of the great treaty between
America and the Motherland had drawn together the
leading intellects of the two countries, and had culminated
in that mighty assemblage in New York
which had stood before the altar of the Eternal Peace
and closed, as it believed for ever, the Temple of the
twin-headed Janus. With the minister had gone
Gabrielle, his only child, and thus for the first time
during her three and twenty years had she seen any
world but that of the suburban parish in which Gordon
Silvester laboured.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">It was a bitter cold night of the memorable winter
with which this story is chiefly concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle wore furs, which had been purchased in
Quebec, and a hat which some upon the steamer had
thought a little <i>outr√©</i> for a parson&#39;s daughter. These
furs she had just laid upon her bed, and was busy
unpinning her hat when her father knocked at the
door and asked if he might come in. She thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
that he was more excited than he was wont to be in
the old days, and there were blotches of crimson upon
his usually sallow cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am just going to bed,&quot; he said in a quiet tone;
&quot;if you want anything to eat, let Jane know. The
room was very hot, I think&mdash;my head is aching.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned with her hand still among the curls of
her auburn hair, a wonderfully graceful figure for
such a scene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must be very tired, dear,&quot; she said very
gently. &quot;I have never heard anything more beautiful
than your speech.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took a step into the room, his hand upon the
door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you think it was a success, Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think at all about it; it was what Mr.
Faber would have called &#39;electrical.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He let go the door, and then shut it behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; he said, as though thinking upon it, &quot;if
we could have had Faber with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed, showing the superb whiteness of her
teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The lion and the lamb. Why do you attach any
importance to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He crossed the room to an arm-chair and sat there,
poking the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is one of the men who can make peace or
war,&quot; he said. &quot;Sir Jules Achon agrees with me.
Popular sentiment goes for much, but the men who
control the destinies are the financiers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, father, how could Mr. Faber control this
particular situation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
&quot;He could set a great example of forbearance.
Is he not rich enough?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She came and sat by him near the fire. It was yet
early in the most memorable winter that England has
ever known, but the cold had become intense.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw so little of Mr. Faber on the ship,&quot; she
said reflectively; &quot;he appeared to me to be a man
who could move mountains ... with somebody
else&#39;s arms, to say nothing of somebody&#39;s else&#39;s
spades.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was that your only impression of him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! force&mdash;hardly of character, perhaps&mdash;that and
his restlessness. Why did everyone talk of him? Was
it because he is worth eleven millions of money? Was
that all that could be said of him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A very good reason nowadays. They say he has a
contract with the French Government for five millions
of the new rifles. Permissible exaggeration makes him
the arbiter of peace or war. Did he not give you that
impression?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hardly think so; he was mostly concerned about
his boarhound&#39;s dinner. As far as I remember, he
considers our party just harmless lunatics. I made
him confess as much one day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester passed by the admission.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He goes on a fearful journey,&quot; he said, falling
unconsciously to the pulpit manner. &quot;Of course such
men know a great deal. He believes that there will
be war in Europe in six months&#39; time, and that our
country will be concerned. Did he not tell you that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think not, father. He was too busy asking me
to arrange the roses in his cabin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
&quot;Ah! I remember them, pink roses everywhere in
early December. What a feminine display!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But not a feminine subject. I have never met a
man whose character impressed me so clearly. He has
only begun in the world&mdash;those were his own words.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, why should he not begin with us?
Sir Jules believes that nothing would make a greater
stir than his joining our Committee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why don&#39;t you ask him yourself? He&#39;s in
London until the end of the week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester did not speak for some minutes. He
seemed to have become a little shy of this outspoken
wide-eyed daughter of his, who evaded the issue so
cleverly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you&#39;d write, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To Mr. Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; you seemed very good friends on the ship.
I believe he&#39;d join if you asked him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe it would make any difference who
asked him. I&#39;ll write, if you wish it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, rising abruptly, &quot;write now before
you go to bed. You&#39;re sure you are not hungry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle laughed lightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have left all my vices in America,&quot; she rejoined,
&quot;being hungry in the witching hours is one of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">Her boudoir overlooked the great well wherein London
lies. Though the moon was in the first quarter,
the night was wonderful in stars, and the air quivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
with the virility of frost. She could see St. Paul&#39;s
and the City spires; the Carlton Hotel lay more to the
west, and was hidden behind the slopes of Haverstock
Hill. There was no snow, for this frost was
black as iron.</p>

<p class="indent">Just below, were the winding walks to which the
pilgrims came in search of Keats. She had read the
sonnets and tried to understand them, but candour
compelled her to say that she preferred Tennyson.
Sometimes she thought her whole interest in literature
to be an affectation; but undoubtedly she was addicted
to erotic poetry and the fire of Swinburne would burn
in her veins. All this, too, was hidden from her father,
who occupied himself but little with her affairs, and
believed that her interests were entirely his own.</p>

<p class="indent">Girls of twenty-three are usually fervent letter-writers
and Gabrielle was no exception. She had furnished
folios of gossip that very day for her friend,
Eva Achon, who had been her intimate upon the ship.
But when it came to writing &quot;John Sebastian Faber,
Esq.,&quot; her pen trembled upon the paper. How impossible
it seemed to say anything to which such a man
would listen. She depicted him as she had last seen
him upon the deck of the <i>Oceanic</i>, stretched on a sofa-chair,
and smiling at her philosophy. &quot;Letters answered
themselves,&quot; he had said. He got through life
on cables and confidence. There was not a private
letter in fifty which said anything worth saying. He
had proposed a league for the suppression of private
correspondence, and begged her to be one of the vice-presidents.
She remembered her own disappointment
that he had not asked her to write to him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
So it was no easy thing at all to begin, chiefly because
she feared his irony and was quite sure that her
letter would achieve nothing. Half-a-dozen sheets
of good &quot;cream laid&quot; note were destroyed before she
could get her craft launched and she was still in harbour
so to speak when she heard her name cried out
in the street below, and opening the window immediately,
discerned Harry Lassett with skates upon his
arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that you, Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The cold was intense and filled the room with icy
vapour. She shivered where she stood, and drew her
dressing-gown close about her white throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whatever are you doing, Harry? It&#39;s nearly
eleven o&#39;clock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that. We&#39;ve been skating on the Vale.
There&#39;ll be grand ice to-morrow. Won&#39;t you come?
You must!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t got any skates!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, send into town for some. I&#39;ll go myself if
you&#39;ll throw me out an old boot. You don&#39;t mean to
say you&#39;re going to miss it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head and tried to shield herself
behind the heavy curtains.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear I&#39;ll have to go visiting to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, those American dollars again! No!
They&#39;re spoiling you; I thought you had done with
that nonsense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not say they were American. I am going
to Richmond to see Eva Achon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, hang Eva Achon. We shall have bandy, if
it holds. Throw me out that boot, and I&#39;ll go away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
Your people go to bed in the middle of the day, don&#39;t
they? It&#39;s all locked up like a prison down here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not in bed, Harry. I am writing a letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;American, of course?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; and she laughed at him. Then the
boot was found, and tossed out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How&#39;s that?&quot; he asked&mdash;a man who had played
for Middlesex and the &#39;Varsities could not have asked
any other question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me know just how much they are, and I will
send it round in the afternoon. Father promised me
a pair to-night. I&#39;m glad you can get them for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right oh! We shall skate on the Vale directly
I return. Dr. Houghton of Grindelwald wants me to
have a pair of his blades. You&#39;d better have the
same. They&#39;re grand!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything you like, my dear Harry, if they&#39;ll keep
me warm. I shall be a pillar of ice if I stand here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Like Lot&#39;s wife! Was it ice, by the way? Well,
good-night, then; or shall I post the letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s splendid of you. I&#39;ll just finish it. But
I&#39;ll have to shut the window.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Imagine me a sentry doing the goose step. Will
you be long?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just two minutes, really.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He kissed his hand to her when she shut the window
and began to stamp about to warm himself. They had
been lovers since children, and were still free. Harry
Lassett&#39;s three hundred a year &quot;in the funds&quot; just
permitted him to play cricket for the county and to
spend the best part of the winter at St. Moritz. He
had not thought much about marriage.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
Gabrielle&#39;s two minutes &quot;really&quot; proved to be an
exact prophecy. Haste bade her throw both preface
and conclusion to the winds. She just wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Faber</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father would be very pleased if you would
become one of the Vice-Presidents of the International
Arbitration League. Will you let me
say &#39;yes&#39; for you?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">And that was the letter Harry carried to the post
for her.</p>

<p class="indent">Vanity promised her an answer. It would come
over the telegraph wires, she thought.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-2" id="ch1-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">A MAN OF DESTINY</p>

<p class="indent">John Sebastian Faber had a suite of five rooms at
the Savoy Hotel, and, as he said, he lived in four of
them most of the time. The room which he did not
occupy was devoted to three secretaries.</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle found him at his desk in an apartment
which should have been a drawing-room. The windows
looked out upon the Shot Tower and showed
him the majesty of Westminster. There was a litter
of American journals upon a round table at his back
and copies of the English <i>Times</i>, much mutilated by
cutting. He wore a black morning coat, and would
have been called well-dressed by an American tailor.</p>

<p class="indent">His was the &quot;clean-limbed&quot; type of man who is
such an excellent product of the sister nation&mdash;moderately
tall, suggesting virility and immense nervous
energy. Someone upon the ship said that he
&quot;snatched at life,&quot; and that was no untrue description
of him. But he had also picked up a little sum of
eleven millions sterling by the process, and that kind
of snatching bears imitation.</p>

<p class="indent">A footman brought Gabrielle to the room, and Faber
sprang up immediately, brushing back curly brown
hair from his forehead. It was evident that he expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
a somewhat protracted interview, for he
wheeled a low chair near to his own before he held
out his hand to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, now, I&#39;m glad to see you. Sit down right
here and let us talk. A long way in from Hampstead,
isn&#39;t it? Too hot, perhaps; well, then, we&#39;ll have the
steam turned off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, please!&quot; she said, casting loose her grey furs&mdash;he
had already regarded her from a man&#39;s first
aspect and approved the picture&mdash;&quot;I have been walking
down the Strand and the air is so cold. It&#39;s delicious
in here&mdash;and what roses!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! that&#39;s where I blush. I always have roses
wherever I go; didn&#39;t your lady from Banbury Cross
do the same thing with the music? Well, I get as far
off that as I can&mdash;most music. Wagner&#39;s good if
you&#39;re up against a man. You never hear him crying
&#39;Enuf.&#39; Well, now, that&#39;s right. So you want me
for the I.A.L.&mdash;or, rather, your father does. Why
didn&#39;t he ask me on the ship?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He swung back in his chair and looked her over
from head to foot. She had always been a little afraid
of the sensitive eyes, and they did not fail to magnetise
her as heretofore. It was possible, however, to be
very frank with such a man; she spoke with good
assurance when she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! I suppose he didn&#39;t think of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean that he didn&#39;t know enough about me?
Why, that&#39;s fair. I dare say he heard my name for
the first time that night I ran the charity concert for
him. Guns and the gospel don&#39;t go well together, my
dear lady, not in civilized parts. Your father won&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
want rifles until he goes to China to turn the great
god Bud inside out. I&#39;ll let him have a consignment
cheap when he&#39;s starting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thought it a little brutal, hardly the thing he
should have said; but his good humour was invincible,
and she forgave him immediately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fact is,&quot; he ran on, &quot;your father is a good
man, Miss Silvester, and I&#39;m a merchant. Where we
come together is in admiring a certain fellow passenger
who ran the ship and will run other ships. There
we&#39;re on common ground. Now say what you like to
me and I&#39;ll hear it, for I&#39;ve just twenty minutes at your
disposal, and you may count every one of them. To
begin with the I.A.L.&mdash;does your father remember
that I&#39;m a gunmaker?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was vastly puzzled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think he knows it in a vague way. The captain
of the <i>Oceanic</i> said you were building the new American
navy&mdash;is that quite true?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be in a prospectus. My house builds
one of the new cruisers, and some of the destroyers.
Guns are the bigger line. I&#39;ve come to Europe to sell
guns. Did they tell you that also?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I think everyone knows it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why come to me? Would you go to the
keeper of a saloon and ask him to help you to put
down the drink? He&#39;d tell you that drink made
George Washington, just as I tell you that guns made
your Lord Nelson. Would the Admiral have joined
your I.A.L.?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, with womanly obstinacy, &quot;then you
still think there is no alternative but war?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
He laughed and began to make holes with his pencil
in the blotting pad before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s just as though you asked me if there were
no alternative but human nature. Why isn&#39;t the world
good right through? Why do murder and other
crimes still exist on the face of the earth? Would a
league suppress them&mdash;a decision at Washington that
there should be no more sin? I guess not. If a man
knocks me down before lunch, I may go to law with
him; if it&#39;s after and there&#39;s been any wine, I&#39;ll possibly
do my own justice and do it quick. War is as
old as human nature, and if we are to believe that a
God rules the world, we&#39;ve got to believe also that
man was meant to go to war. Shall I tell you that
some of the noblest things done on this earth were
done on the battlefield? You wouldn&#39;t believe me.
Your father thinks George Washington a son of the
devil, and Nelson a man of blood. I&#39;ve heard that
sort of thing from the platform, and it&#39;s turned me
sick. Your I.A.L. is a league for the manufacture of
lath-backed men. Do you think the world will be
any better when every man turns the other cheek and
honour has gone into the pot? If you do, well, I&#39;m
on the other side all the time. War may go, but it
has got to change human nature first. Tell your
father that, and ask him to think about it. I wonder
what text he&#39;d take if a troop of cavalry camped in
his drawing-room to-night. Would the I.A.L. do
much for him? Why, I think not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled at his wild images, and thought that she
would demolish them simply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You speak in fables,&quot; she said, &quot;it&#39;s like the nonsense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
in the panicky stories. There is no one in England
nowadays who seriously believes in that kind of
war. I do not think you can do so yourself. Now,
really, did you ever see a battlefield in your life, Mr.
Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her with eyes half shut.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was in Port Arthur the night the ships were
struck. I saw the big fighting at Liaoyang. Go back
farther and I&#39;ll tell you stories of Venezuela and the
Philippines, which should be written down in red.
I&#39;m a child of war&mdash;my father died at a barricade in
Paris three days before the Commune fell. A diamond
of a man saved my mother and took her out to
America, where I was born. There&#39;s war in the very
marrow of my bones&mdash;I live for it as other men for
women and children. Should you ask such a man to
join such a League? I&#39;ll put it squarely to you. Now
tell me the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The intensity of the appeal startled her. The
method of her life in the parsonage at Hampstead
would have prompted a platitude of the platforms,
some retort about the progress of humanity, and the
need for social advance. But it seemed impossible to
say such things to John Faber. Her courage ran down
as ice before a fire; she was wholly embarrassed and
without resource.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come,&quot; he repeated, &quot;you owe me the admission.
Should the request have been made to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed&mdash;and yet I will not say that anyone
would be dishonoured by it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did I suggest the contrary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think your idols false.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
&quot;They are the idols of human nature&mdash;not mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We could say the same of the primitive savages.
Why should we have advanced beyond the battle-axe
and the club?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not the political clubs&mdash;see here, is there any real
advance when the knife goes deep enough? Suppose a
thousand English women were butchered in China&mdash;or
I&#39;ll make it Turkey&mdash;would your father be for the
I.A.L.? If he were, the people would burn his
pulpit!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It only means that we must educate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re doing it all the time. Does education make
your burglar sing psalms, or does it teach him to use
oxygen for burning open the safe? I think nothing
of education&mdash;that way. Who are the best educated
people in Europe? The Germans. Are they coming
in to the I.A.L.?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father hopes that much may be done by the
understanding between the ministers&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed rudely, brutally.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the sheep baaing together, and the wolf
sharpening his teeth on the national grindstone. I&#39;ve
no patience to hear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I certainly will not repeat it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A flush of anger coloured her cheeks, and her heart
began to beat fast. She was conscious of a r√¥le which
fitted her but ill, and was no reflection of herself. How
much sooner would she have been downstairs among
the well-dressed women who were beginning to flock
into the restaurant for lunch! This man&#39;s brutal logic
threatened to shatter her professed ideals, and to leave
her vanity defenceless. She remembered at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
time what the meaning of the triumph would be if
she won him. All the country would talk of that!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not offended with me?&quot; he said in a
gentler tone. &quot;I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be when you get
back home and think of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall try to think of it as little as possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As your countrymen are doing. If there was more
than half-an-ounce of the radium of common sense in
this kingdom at the present moment, some people
would be thinking very hard, Miss Silvester&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He rose from his chair, thrust his hands deep into
his trousers pockets, went over to the window and
stood looking out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They would be thinking of the frost,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps it is too cold to think about it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well said and true. Did you read in the <i>Times</i>
that there is ice in the English Channel for the first
time for twenty years?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never read the <i>Times</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then don&#39;t begin if you would remain a woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she, then, unworthy of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all&mdash;it is unworthy of her. It tells the
truth!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I grant that that is embarrassing sometimes.
We were speaking of the frost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the fables. The fable, written by a great
German, is about to freeze the English Channel and
the North Sea! Ice from the Humber to Kiel! Portsmouth
frozen up. An ice carnival at the Thames&#39;
mouth. Do you believe in fables?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
She stared at him amazed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What would happen if this one were true?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;you had better ask the I.A.L.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was silent a little while, then she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your bogies are wonderful. Are there many in
your life?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;More than I count.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are lucky then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, for one of them sends you to my rooms
to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had never spoken to her in this way before, and
the tone of it found her amazed. Hitherto the man
of affairs and the woman of the useful vanities had
been speaking; but John Faber had changed all that in
an instant. She felt his wide eyes focused upon her
with a sudden glance which burned. He had taken a
step toward her, and for a moment she feared that
some mad impulse would drive him to forget the true
circumstance of their meeting, and to suppose another.
She felt her heart beat rapidly&mdash;a true instinct warned
her to act upon the defensive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think we were talking of another kind of bogy,&quot;
she said quickly&mdash;&quot;women deserve a new chapter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed a little hardly, and turned upon his
heel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The goose awoke and the Capitol is saved. Well,
about this frost?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I shall hope for a thaw.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s what your I.A.L. is doing all the time.
Tell them that John Faber wishes them well, and will
sell them a hundred thousand rifles any time they
are reconsidering the position. Perhaps I shall meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
you when I return from Paris. We can put the contract
through then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head, trying to hide the annoyance
of the rebuff.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t suppose I shall ever see you again,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll bet you a thousand dollars you do, either in
Paris or Berlin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should I go there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because your little friend Claudine d&#39;Arny will
see that you do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that was only an acquaintance on the ship.
I had forgotten her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My memory is better. I have been chewing her
father&#39;s name for twenty years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know him, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was his turn to laugh&mdash;with the silent anger of
a man who remembers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He gave the order for my father to be shot. I
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll forget him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She hardly believed him to be serious. There he
stood, smiling softly, one hand deep in his trousers
pocket, the other toying with his roses. He had just
told her what he would have told no other woman in
England, and she thought him a jester.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this one of the fables?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly it is. I am going to Paris to write the
moral.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She watched his face curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, surely, if General d&#39;Arny gave any such order,
it was in his official capacity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I shall give mine&mdash;in an official capacity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
&quot;Then you have not forgiven him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is for that very purpose I am going to Paris.
That and one other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To sell your guns&mdash;I read it in the papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled&mdash;in a kindly way this time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll give you twenty guesses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am hopeless at riddles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I&#39;ll solve this one for you. I am going to
Paris to give one million dollars to the man who took
my mother to America&mdash;if I can find him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you will succeed&mdash;and I wish I knew the
man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He liked this, for it was the first really girlish thing
she had said. Perhaps even at that stage Faber read
her wholly, and believed that it was good for her to
see &quot;common sense in curl papers,&quot; as he put it. He
might even have led her to talk of her father and her
home had not the inexorable secretary knocked upon
the door at that very moment. The summons brought
him to &quot;attention,&quot; as the call of a sergeant to the new
recruit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Time is unkind to us,&quot; he said. &quot;I must go down
to Throgmorton Street to make a hundred thousand
dollars. Well, we shall meet again in Paris or Berlin.
A thousand dollars for your I.A.L. if we don&#39;t. Remember
me to your father, please. Is he likely to accept
that call to Yonkers, by the way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she said quite simply; &quot;he is so
ignorant about American money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Faber smiled at that. Gabrielle went down
the Strand blushing furiously, and wondering why she
had said anything at once so honest and so foolish.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span></p>

<h2><a name="ch1-3" id="ch1-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">Clad in an alpaca coat, which had long since lost
its lining, and in carpet slippers very much too large
for him, Gordon Silvester awaited his daughter&#39;s return
to the house in Well Walk. The luncheon bell
had rung a second time, and God alone knew what was
in the mind of Agatha, the cook. Silvester feared this
woman greatly, especially in those frequently recurring
seasons when her madness ran to taking the
pledge.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a quarter past two when Gabrielle returned,
and they should have lunched at half-past one. The
minister&#39;s anxiety was above all meats, and in his
curiosity to know what had happened he forgot the
sainted martyr below stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, is he willing, my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle drew a chair to the table; she carried a
couple of letters in her hand, and glanced at their
envelopes while she spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my dear father, it was quite hopeless.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester sighed, and took up his knife and fork.
It was a terrible descent from the millennium to mutton;
but, after all, he ate but to live.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feared it would be so. Well, we have done our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
best, and that is something. Did he give you any
reasons?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One tremendous reason&mdash;he calls it human nature.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester helped her to a fair cut and himself to
two. He was already eating when he took up the
subject again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This movement will be stronger than his argument,&quot;
he said. &quot;What people call human nature is often
little more than the animal instinct. I can conceive no
nobler mission for any man. We cannot expect this
particular class of man to see eye to eye with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was never any chance of it, father. He
believes that war is the will of God, and he does not
hesitate to say so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would he have us to believe that typhoid fever is
the will of God&mdash;or smallpox? We are stamping those
out. Why not the greater plague?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you had been there to argue with him,
father. A girl is at such a disadvantage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naturally, with such a man. I don&#39;t suppose John
Faber ever knew one really human weakness since he
was a child. Did he say anything about me, by the
way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He mentioned you several times. I told him
about the call to Yonkers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The minister&#39;s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a subject I would gladly take his advice
upon. What did he say about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very little, I think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was it favourable to my going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think he expressed an opinion either way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
&quot;It would have been a great help to me had he done
so. Sometimes I feel that I have a great work to do
in America. This Peace Movement is the finest thing
in the story of the whole world. Christ Himself has
taught us no more beautiful idea&mdash;His own, as we
must admit. There is a true sentiment in America;
but a pretence of it here, I fear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you quite sure of that, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of what, my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of the true sentiment in America. Mr. Faber
said on the ship that he hoped to sell five hundred
thousand rifles for Mexico before the trouble was over.
Is that a true sentiment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe it very foreign to the real wishes of the
American people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He doesn&#39;t; neither do the Germans. They say
all this talk of arbitration is so much humbug to prevent
us adding to our navy, and to allow President
Taft to occupy Mexico.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is in the yellow press, my dear; you should
not listen to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anyway, Sir Jules Achon thinks it true. May I
read Eva&#39;s letter? I expect she reminds me of my
promise to go there to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know that we have a meeting of the Girls&#39;
Friendly Committee to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, father, can&#39;t they do without me for once? I
don&#39;t often stay away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He helped himself to an apple tart, and made no
reply. Gabrielle read her letter, and her cheeks flamed
with excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think?&quot; she said. &quot;Sir Jules is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
going on his yacht to Corfu, and he wishes me to go
with them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To go upon his yacht!&quot; The astonishment was
very natural. &quot;That is very kind of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Douglas Renshaw is going, and Dr. Burrall. Eva
says they will call at Lisbon and Gibraltar, and perhaps
at Genoa. What a splendid trip!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes were very bright with the vision, and her
lips parted in excitement. Not only was this a respite
from the monotonous days, but a respite which she
would consider regal. She was going upon a pilgrimage
into the old world as she had gone into the new.
And with the promise there flashed upon her mind a
memory of John Faber&#39;s wager. He would meet her
in Paris or Berlin!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is indeed a very remarkable opportunity,&quot; said
her father presently. &quot;Sir Jules Achon is a greater
man than your American. He has more ballast, and
quite as much money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he has not come to Europe to marry an English
woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The minister looked at her covertly. A secret
thought which had sent her to the Savoy Hotel whispered
an accusation in his ear, and found him guilty.
He would have given much to know just what passed
between Gabrielle and John Faber. Perhaps he saw
also that his daughter had never looked so well. Undoubtedly
she was a beautiful woman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said at last; &quot;I don&#39;t think Sir Jules
will marry. You must accept this invitation, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what am I to do for frocks?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
&quot;Can&#39;t you wear those you took to America?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear father, they were mostly summer
dresses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Corfu is a summer resort. I forget what
the winter temperature is&mdash;something abnormal. Unfortunately,
they have just opened a gambling saloon
there. Wherever nature is most beautiful, there men
turn their backs upon her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir Jules is hardly likely to do that. He is going
to Corfu to try to meet the German Emperor. You
know he has a great idea&mdash;the Federation of Europe.
He says that commerce is the only key to the peace
of the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A faith rather in the Jews than the Divine gospels.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! I think not&mdash;a faith in good common sense,
father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will not associate himself with us,&quot; he said,
a little sadly. And then, &quot;They tell me he is a very
rich man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just the reason why I must have some frocks if
I go to Corfu.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">She was not to leave for Richmond until the end of
the week, and when lunch was over she was reminded
of Harry Lassett&#39;s promise by the advent of that
boisterous sportsman and his expressed determination
to take her at once to the Vale of Health pond, where
the ice was &quot;top-notch.&quot; There Gabrielle found herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
amid a knot of very suburban but friendly people,
whose noisy cordiality forced her to remember that
this rather than the other was her true sphere.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry Lassett had been down to St. James&#39;s Street
to get her skates, and they fitted her to perfection.
The scene was inspiriting and full of colour. All
about them lay the whitened heath; London beneath
a veil of sunlit fog in the hollow. So keen was the
splendid air that every nerve reverberated at its breath.
Such frost had not been known in England since oxen
were roasted whole upon the Thames in the early
days of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class="indent">She was a good skater, and had often accompanied
Eva Achon to Princes during the previous season.
Harry Lassett waltzed divinely, and while waltzing
upon boards was anathema to Gordon Silvester, waltzing
upon the ice seemed to him a harmless diversion.
He even came down to the brink of the pond and
watched the merry throng at play; but that was
before dusk fell and the great bonfire was lighted, and
those who had merely clasped hands discovered that
a more binding link was necessary. Silvester saw
nothing of the outrageous flirtations. He would have
been sadly distressed had he known that Gabrielle
herself was among the number of the sinners. She
was, in fact, one of the ringleaders.</p>

<p class="indent">Why should she not have been? What pages of
her life written in the dark room of a shabby parsonage
forbade that freshet of a young girl&#39;s spirit, here
gushing from the wells of convention which so long
had preserved it? Silvester, all said and done, was
just a successful Congregational minister. His sincerity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
and natural gifts of eloquence had pushed him
into the first rank of well-advertised special pleaders.
By this cause and that, the doors had been opened
to him; and with him went Gabrielle to the ethical
fray. If her heart remained with those whom the
world would have called &quot;her equals,&quot; she was but
obeying the fundamental laws of human nature. Millionaires
and their palaces; my lord this and my lord
that, thrust into the chair of a cause for which they
did not care a snap of the fingers&mdash;what had Silvester&#39;s
house in common with them? Reason answered
nothing; he himself would never have put the
question.</p>

<p class="indent">So here was Gabrielle like a child let out of school.
The long afternoon found her pirouetting with
Harry Lassett, or with other disorderly young men of
a like nature; the swift night discovered her in a sentimental
mood, with all thought of multi-millionaires
gone away to the twinkling stars. A brass band had
begun to play by that time, and a man was selling
baked chestnuts. A pretty contrast that to the Savoy
Hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">Their talk had been chiefly ejaculatory during the
afternoon, but the twilight found them mellowing.
Harry still harped upon America, and with some disdain;
and now, at length, his contempt found expression.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you see that American chap all right?&quot; he
asked her in an interval of the riot.</p>

<p class="indent">She admitted the guilt of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean Mr. Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fellow you met on the ship&mdash;Apollo and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
liar; the man who talked about eleven millions sterling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I saw him. How did you know I was going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! I was in the Savoy myself this morning. I&#39;m
thinking of buying the place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you propose to settle down?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or settle up. What did you want from the Stars
and Stripes this morning, Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An impertinent question. Why should I tell you?
Why do you want to know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I have the right to know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The right, Harry&mdash;the right!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were over at the eastern corner of the pond,
shadows sheltering them. Harry Lassett&#39;s &quot;six foot
one&quot; towered above her five feet five, and made a
woman of her. He had the round, &quot;apple&quot; face of
a boy of twenty-four, vast shoulders, limbs of iron.
His eyes were clear and lustrous, and his hair jet black.
There was every quality which makes a quick, physical
appeal to the other sex, and now, perhaps not for
the first time, Gabrielle became acutely conscious of
it. This was something totally apart from schemes
for the world&#39;s good; something with which millionaires,
were they British or American, had no concern
whatever. Ten years of a boy and girl friendship
culminated here. She tried to withdraw her fingers
from Harry&#39;s grasp, but could not release herself; his
breath was hot upon her forehead; she quivered at his
touch, and then stood very still.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why have I not got the right? Who has if I
haven&#39;t?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The right to what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
&quot;To warn Apollo off. Gabrielle, I&#39;m in love with
you&mdash;you know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up; his eyes devoured her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the good of our being in love?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t mean to say you are thinking of the
beastly money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Harry!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, don&#39;t ask me. I&#39;ve three hundred a
year, and I&#39;m going with Barlean in Throgmorton
Street when the cricket season&#39;s over. That&#39;s a half-commission
job, and my cricketing friends will rally
round. If I tour Australia next year, they&#39;ll pay
my expenses, and I&#39;ll make them pretty hot. We could
be married when I come back, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed, and half turned her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s quite like a fairy story. And so mercenary!
It&#39;s just like a business deal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, your father will ask for a balance sheet,
and there it is&mdash;totted up by &#39;Why not&#39; and audited
by &#39;Expectation.&#39; Why don&#39;t you say something
about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you want me to say that you will always be
my best friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Family Reading</i>&mdash;go on. Love and respect and
esteem. I&#39;m d&mdash;&mdash;d if I stand it. This is what I
think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He slipped his arms about her, and kissed her hotly
upon the lips. She had never been kissed by a man
before, and the swift assault found her without argument.
She was conscious in a vague way that prudence
should have made an end of all this upon the
spot. Yet there was a physical magnetism before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
which she was powerless; an instantaneous revelation
of life in its fuller meaning, of a sentiment which had
nothing to do with prudence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Harry!&quot; she cried, and that was all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gabrielle, you love me&mdash;I feel that you do when
you are near me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How foolish it all is&mdash;how mad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t have that rot. Why, you are part of
my life, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, we are very old friends&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you say any word like that I will take you
out into the very centre of the pond and kiss you
there. Come along and skate now. I feel quite
mad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He caught her in his arms, and they went whirling
away. The red-nosed man with the cornet played the
&quot;Merry Widow&quot; until his whole body swelled; there
were harsh tones of cockneyism, silver laughter of
boys and girls, the whirr of good skates cutting the
ice. And above all a clear, starless heaven, such as
London had not known for many a year.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How long will you be away with these Achon
people, Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know; we are going to Corfu to see the
German Emperor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t bring him back with you. He&#39;d never get
on with fools. Isn&#39;t it all rather out of the picture?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean by that, Harry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, your trotting about with millionaires, hanging
on to the skirts of other people&#39;s ambitions. It
can&#39;t last. Some day soon, these doors will be shut.
There&#39;ll be nobody at home when you call.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
&quot;That would not trouble me. I go because my
father wishes it; and, of course, I like Eva.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s rather a jolly girl, isn&#39;t she? They&#39;re a
different class to that Faber man. He&#39;s just an adventurer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who has managed to make himself necessary to
two continents. I wish you knew him. You&#39;d be the
first to bow down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To eleven millions! I might if he handed over
one of them. That must be the fly in his ointment.
I don&#39;t suppose he has a friend in the world who
doesn&#39;t want to get something out of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you include me in that category?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you wanted his name. I knew he&#39;d laugh
at all that peace rot. It&#39;s the greatest humbug of the
twentieth century, and I admire the German Emperor
for his courage. He and Kitchener are the two greatest
men in the world to-day. Now, don&#39;t you think so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think anything of the kind. If there is
any one conviction in my life that is sincere it is this.
You know it, Harry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was very earnest, and he would not wound her.
Gabrielle Silvester could dream dreams, and some
of them would put great intellects to shame. Harry
knew this and admired her in the mood; he altered
his own course at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I know it. But tell me, what did Faber
say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, very little&mdash;he spoke about the frost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wants to skate with you, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think not. He is full of bogies. The English
Channel and the North Sea are to be frozen over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
&quot;Great idea that. We shall skate all the way to
Paris! Dine at the Ritz and curl afterwards. What
a man!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, really&mdash;what he fears is a panic in England
if the sea should really freeze.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Harry thought about it for some minutes in silence.
Presently he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe it could happen. He was chaffing
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think he was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if it did happen&mdash;by gad! what a funk some
people would be in!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The valiant people&mdash;who believe in war in the abstract.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you&#39;re ironical, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she said; &quot;I&#39;m only hungry.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">It was very dark in Well Walk when they arrived
before her father&#39;s house.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry had fallen to a sentimental mood, and would
talk about their future just as though it had all been
settled in the beginning of things, and was as unalterable
as the course of the planets. She began to think
that his love for her was very real, and not a mere
ebullition of a boyish sentiment. Long years of her
childhood seemed to be lived again as he put his arm
about her and told her of his happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You knew it all the time, Gabrielle. You never
had any doubt about it. Of course, I loved you. Tell
me so yourself. Let me see it in your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
She laughed, and told him, as the situation seemed
to require, not to be foolish.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father will be waiting for me. What shall I say
to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I am going to marry you directly I return
from the Australian tour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why frighten him prematurely? There are thousands
of pretty girls in Australia.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s beastly of you. Deny it, or I will kiss
you again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Harry, my cheeks will be so red.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say it&#39;s the frost. I must kiss you, Gabrielle.
There&mdash;little cat! Why do you wrestle with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I feel that we are just two children playing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you&#39;ll never play with any other child&mdash;swear
that to me, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Harry, that would be the most childish
thing of all. Now, you must say good-night, I hear
my father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He held her for an instant in his arms, and she
trembled. When at length he strode off in his masterful
and imperious way, her father stood in the porch
and called her. He had seen nothing of this curiously
&quot;worldly&quot; scene, and was full of a letter he had just
received from the Archbishop of Canterbury. This
invited him to a Conference at the Mansion House,
and he pointed out with satisfaction that it had been
written at the archiepiscopal palace at Lambeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This movement may not bring all the nations in,
or make them dwell together in harmony and peace,
he said, &quot;but it will certainly bring peace to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
churches. Of course, they will ask me to speak,
Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When is it for, father?&quot; she asked him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In ten days&#39; time&mdash;at the Mansion House.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will have to get a typewriter; I shall be at
Richmond.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it is better. I should not like Sir Jules
or Mr. Faber to know that you do such work, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; she said with a light laugh, &quot;I don&#39;t think
they would be shocked, father. They are both self-made
men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but self-made men rarely like self-made
women. It&#39;s the way of the world. If we go to
America&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you do not intend to accept the call from
Yonkers, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A man might do a great work over there. My
imagination is sorely tempted. I am altogether at a
loss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was too tired to take up the ancient arguments
which this threadbare question had provoked. Later
on, in her own bedroom, she sat before a brisk fire, and
tried to take stock of the varied events of that busy
day.</p>

<p class="indent">Vaguely out of the mists there emerged the truth,
that two men had made love to her, and that one was
a man who might presently rule the Western world.
She could look down a vista of fable land to a future
surpassing all expectations of her dreams, and believe
that at a word she might enter in. The obverse of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
the medal was Harry Lassett and the story of her
youth. This lad had crept into the secret places of
her heart. She still trembled at a memory of his
kisses. With him, life would be meticulous&mdash;a villa
and a trim maidservant. His scheme of things could
embrace no great idea; and yet he, too, was a popular
hero, and great throngs would go to Lords to see him
play. Gabrielle knew that she loved him; but she
doubted if her love would prove as strong as the
dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">It was midnight when she undressed.</p>

<p class="indent">The weather had turned much warmer. She opened
her window to discover that it was snowing, and that
the snow melted as it fell.</p>

<p class="indent">The fables were already discredited. It seemed
almost an omen.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-4" id="ch1-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">THE BEGINNING OF THE ODYSSEY</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie Morris was a very fair type of the American
journalist, whose body goes to Paris while he
lives, whatever may happen to his soul at a later period.</p>

<p class="indent">Thirty-one years of age, he knew the world backwards;
was as much at home in Port Said as in Philadelphia;
wrote as though kings were his boon companions
and had settled the hash of more than one
intrepid lady with polyandric tendencies. The product
is purely twentieth century, and frequently has
flaxen hair. Bertie was becoming bald in the services
of the <i>New York Mitre</i>. He was blessed with a proprietor
who would have drawn blood out of a stone
and then complained of its quality.</p>

<p class="indent">When John Faber left London, he went straight
through to Paris, and there chose Bertie Morris for
his guide. This young man had specialised in the
Franco-German war, and knew the whole story of the
Paris Commune intimately. Fired by the splendid
opportunity of hob-nobbing with one of the richest
men in the world (and of eating his dinners), Bertie
set out gaily upon his fortunate pilgrimage. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
hired an old soldier, by name Picard, who had served
under General d&#39;Arny when that worthy shot down
the revolutionaries as though they had been French
partridges; and with this fellow for a guide, he and
John Faber set off for Belleville and Vincennes.</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie&#39;s vocabulary, it should be said, was chiefly
exclamatory when he was not translating. He was
a fluent Frenchman, and had an uncommonly sound
knowledge of his subject. Listening to him in more
restrained moods, Faber lived again those bloody
days which had cost his father his life, and indirectly
had established his own fortune. All the ferocity,
the savage brutality, the hopeless idealism of the
Commune came to be understood by him. Here had
the trade by which he lived prospered greatly. It
had dyed those stones with blood some forty years
ago.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, shall we begin with Belleville or the Bois?&quot;
Morris had asked him. He thought that it would be
best to work round the city to his father&#39;s old house
near the Jardin du Luxembourg. But first he had
a question to put.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What I want to know is this,&quot; he asked: &quot;How
did it all begin? What set a handful of red republicans
trying to fight a country? It&#39;s a big thing to
have done, anyway. What put it into their heads?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie Morris liked the subject, and entered upon
it with true American zest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; he said, &quot;war was at the back of it. You&#39;ve
seen the same thing in Russia. Peace keeps the lid
on the pot of revolution; war spills the stew. There
were just two or three hundred thousand descendants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
of the old Jacobins in Paris, and when Napoleon III.
was sent into Germany, they made up their minds
to keep him there. Directly peace with Germany was
signed, all the wild men came out. You had every
kind of crank and others. There were big men and
little, dreamers and red devils; they meant to govern
Paris on the &#39;help yourself&#39; plan, and they didn&#39;t
begin so badly. But for Thiers and a few million sane
folk behind him, I don&#39;t doubt they would have
enjoyed themselves finely. As it was, what they
divided were bayonets, and there were plenty to go
round.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He rattled on, appealing often to the old soldier
Picard and proud of his staccato knowledge. Faber
listened with interest but said very little. He was
trying, while they drove through the narrow streets
to P√®re la Chaise, to realise what this Paris had been
when his father lived and worked in it during the
fateful years before the war of 1870. The first John
Faber also had been something of a republican; had
dreamed dreams of the millennium and of the rights
of the proletariat. And the French had dragged him
out and shot him for his pains. He had died protesting
that he was an American citizen.</p>

<p class="indent">A big Merc√©d√®s car carried the pilgrims upon this
journey, and its welcome in the black streets of Belleville
was not blandly enthusiastic. Blue blouses at
the doors of the wine shops spat upon the pavement
and cursed the bourgeoisie; coarse women with skirts
hanging about them like rags laughed brutalities and
flung indecencies after them. There were pale-faced
Apaches and white and callous children. It was inevitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
that these should suggest their forbears of
1870, and even the old soldier remarked the fact:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They would burn Paris again to-morrow, messieurs&mdash;as
I have seen it burned already. Ah! the
terrible days!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He tried to give them a picture of the fateful week&mdash;the
last of the month of May and of the Commune.
The Communards had been driven into the eastern
labyrinth of the city then, he said, and in the anger
of defeat had sent their women forth to burn this
Paris which could not defend them. Since Nero fiddled,
no such spectacle had been seen in Europe. The
old man told them the story with eyes uplifted and
hands clenched. He had become as a child, and these
were the scenes of his youth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was on the Tuesday night that they burned
the palace of the Tuileries,&quot; he said. &quot;The women
went out with naphtha; I saw them running like
devils through the streets and crying to one another
to fire the houses. The day before that, the H√¥tel de
Ville flamed up. They say it was an accident, but&mdash;God
knows. The &#39;Council of State,&#39; the Bank, the
Bourse, the Church of St. Eustache, all were burned
those terrible days. There was one bank of the river
a wall of fire on the Wednesday night; a man could
have read his paper at Passy. It was as light as day,
they told me, in the park at Versailles. All the streets
were full of wild, screaming people; but if you went
a little way toward the Bois you heard the cannon,
you stumbled over the dead. What a butchery was
that, messieurs! God help those who went out of
their houses to see what the soldiers were doing!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
Ladmirault, Galifet, Vinot, Cissey&mdash;those were the
names of the generals. They held their courts under
the trees, in the caf√©s, at the street corners. It was
sufficient to have worn a blouse, to be sorry for the
dead, to express displeasure at what was being done&mdash;away
went such a man or woman to the nearest wall.
We are now coming to the Rue Lafayette. I was in
this very street when my company seized the Communard,
Varlin, and dragged him up to the Buttes
Montmartre. They tied his hands behind his back
and cut his face with their sabres while he walked. It
was a horrible thing to see, messieurs! When he could
no longer walk, they carried him until someone thought
it time to kill him with the butt end of a musket.
They say he was the cleverest member of the Commune&mdash;I
do not know; I was only of the infantry
of the line, and their politics did not concern me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber listened to all this with the interest of a
man who is obsessed by one dominating idea. This
Commune had been the first attempt in modern times
to set up the socialism of Marx&mdash;and in what had it
ended? In a deluge of blood, and the derision of all
sane people. He wondered what would have been
the modern story of Paris if F√©lix Pyat and his fellows
had been stronger than Thiers and the Versaillese.
A consummate knowledge of modern politics
reminded him that the blue blouses of France were still
socialistic to the core, and that individualism sat upon
a throne of straw. He had often thought that such
fortunes as his own would never be made by generations
to come; but that concerned him little, for he
had no children. The reflection brought an image of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
Gabrielle Silvester to his mind. It was odd that he
should think of her while the old soldier related these
bloody scenes.</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie Morris, on the other hand, enjoyed himself
immensely. He drove his tame millionaire as far up
the Butte as he could, and even took him to the Rue
Lepic and the Moulin de la Galette. He was a prize
to be shown to artists and authors, poor devils who
would dine that night for fifty sous and sell their
masterpieces for as many to-morrow. This pilgrimage
of the ateliers was not unwelcome to Faber, and
was made at his own request.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to hear of a man,&quot; he said, &quot;Louis de
Paleologue is his name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where do you think he hides up?&quot; Bertie asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber said that he had no idea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was drawing for Gavarnie some forty years
ago. I&#39;ve never heard of him since, and I wasn&#39;t
born then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, that&#39;s simple. Has he any grandfathers
alive?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a fine story,&quot; was the quiet response. &quot;I
only learned it a year or two back, when I found some
of my mother&#39;s papers. Louis de Paleologue was the
man who took her over to America when General
d&#39;Arny shot my father. There was a pile of correspondence
between them, and it does the man great
credit. If I find him living I&#39;ll give him a million
dollars, if he&#39;ll take them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie Morris whistled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t suggest a preliminary canter. Why
not try it on the dog? He&#39;s willing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
&quot;Most dogs are. My world is all barking. You
find Paleologue for me, and see what Father Christmas
puts in your stocking. He&#39;s the only man in
Europe I ever did want to see outside my own business.
It&#39;s natural that I can&#39;t find him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you tell me anything about him? Where did
he live? What was he? For whom did he work?
I&#39;m right out for this, Mr. Faber.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was an artist who drew small pictures with
a large genius. They say he worked for Hachette.
The last letters speaks of his marriage&mdash;it must have
been written many years ago. I cabled to Paris when
it came into my hands, and the answer back from
your office was that he had gone to the East. That
means Paleologue was a Roumanian, and he&#39;s gone
home. I suppose I shall have to follow him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be a bully trip, anyway. Why not do
the Balkans in a motor? There was a chap here last
month who had just come back. They didn&#39;t shoot
him this time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I guess they won&#39;t shoot me, either. I&#39;m
buying a yacht directly. Now, let&#39;s go and lunch.
Your young Raphaels are rather greasy. I think I&#39;d
like to wash.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">They lunched near the Bourse, in a flaring caf√©
whither the jobbers resorted. There were a few conspicuous
women of the company, loudly dressed and
aggressive in the true spirit of their commercial patrons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
These liked neither English nor Americans,
and said so by face and gesture. The jobbers themselves
looked a gloomy troop, though whether depressed
by their hopes of gain or surety of loss it
would have been difficult to say. Had they known
that John Sebastian Faber sat cheek by jowl with
them, it would have been another story. How many
a time had he, from his distant office in New York,
set that same market hoarse with excitement, filled
the streets with bawling madmen, and put ropes of
pearls about the necks of the cocottes who now made
inelegant grimaces at him when the clients had their
backs turned. He thought of it with some pleasure
over a <i>sole meringue</i>. They would have been down
upon him like a pack of wolves had they known him.</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie Morris enjoyed his <i>d√©jeuner</i> with the satisfaction
of a man who knows he is not paying for it.
He had a programme for the afternoon, which was
to be capped by a dinner at the Ritz Hotel, also at
Faber&#39;s expense. It never occurred to him that he
was not putting his companion under a large obligation,
and the whole tone of his talk was autocratic,
as one who should say, &quot;I open all doors.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll trot out to the Avenue de Nancy and see
where the Versaillese came in,&quot; he put it cheerfully.
&quot;It was on a Sunday, Picard tells me, and the fraternity
lot got a few shells for breakfast. They had just
made up their minds that the millennium had come,
when Vinot and Ladmirault turned up with the cannon.
They had a good deal in common afterwards&mdash;chiefly
explosive. I&#39;ll show you a house at Passy with
a shell in the wall over the front door. The owner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
won&#39;t have it touched. It&#39;s right there, just where
the Versaillese put it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A kind of keepsake. Do they remember anything
about all this in Paris nowadays?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the first of May, before they get drunk. I
don&#39;t think it comes up at any other time. The century
isn&#39;t interested overmuch in yesterday. It&#39;s all
&#39;to-morrow&#39; nowadays.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know that I quarrel with that. Half the
people would commit suicide if it wasn&#39;t for to-morrow.
We&#39;re a sort of recurring decimal, but we don&#39;t
believe it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, then you don&#39;t believe overmuch in the
&#39;destiny&#39; department?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not. A few things are going on all the time&mdash;very
few. The civilization of Babylon was pretty
much the civilization of Rome; while Rome wasn&#39;t
so very different from ourselves. There&#39;s a little
levelling of the classes; but there&#39;s no longer a goal,
either in heaven or hell. That means a soulless people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it marches all the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where science leads it. There&#39;s the only clear
thinking. What&#39;s the good of talking when men don&#39;t
know why they&#39;re here, or what they are? When they
had heaven and hell, they thought clearly enough.
Your new gospel leads them into a morass. It couldn&#39;t
very well lead them anywhere else. The things that
go on evolve as we ourselves have evolved. All the
politicians, parliaments, philosophers don&#39;t help them
a jot. They were saying the same thing on the top
of monoliths before the flood. We are driven&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
we don&#39;t know why or whither unless we believe, as
all but the fools have believed, by Almighty God.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie Morris helped himself to an orange salad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, why don&#39;t you write all this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I&#39;ve something better to do. My business
is to make guns and to sell &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The journalist pricked up his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was some talk of a big contract of yours
going through here. Is that right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! you&#39;d pay something to know&mdash;and a good
many more. Did they couple d&#39;Arny to the talk?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it&#39;s chiefly up to him. He&#39;s a lot of backers
up against him in the Chambers. Jaur√©s says he&#39;s
corrupt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;d have to be in his job. We&#39;re all corrupt,
for that matter. I believe that Walpole&#39;s right. I&#39;d
buy any man body and soul for a price.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And women too&mdash;I don&#39;t think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No money is too much for a good woman,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">They followed the programme afterwards, driving
right round the Bois and returning to the Jardin du
Luxembourg.</p>

<p class="indent">The day had fallen bitterly cold again, and a light
snow whitened the trees in the famous avenues. Paris
took a romantic mantle and covered her pretty shoulders
daintily. Habitu√©s fled to the caf√©s and ensconced
themselves in warm corners; fur-clad women sank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
deep in the cushions of their motors; there were ridiculously
dressed children scampering about the Bois
and crying, &quot;<i>Dieu, comme il fait froid</i>&quot;&mdash;a fairy-like
scene quite characteristic of a city which is rarely
serious, and then tragically so. Through this Faber
passed to his father&#39;s house. He had become silent
and preoccupied&mdash;a man of few emotions, but of one
which had never been absent from his life.</p>

<p class="indent">His father! How often he had tried to create the
living man from the insufficient pictures of that time!</p>

<p class="indent">They had told him that John Faber was tall and
Saxon haired&mdash;a cheery, business-like, unobtrusive fellow,
very generous, far-seeing beyond his epoch. He
had founded the house of Faber at Charleston, and
had come over to Europe to learn Eastern methods.
He was in Paris for the purpose of studying the new
French artillery when the war broke out, and had
lived for three months there, in the little house overlooking
the gardens of the Luxembourg. Such was
the man whom General d&#39;Arny had shot in that very
street, swearing he was of the Communards. A fever
of anger fell suddenly upon the son as he remembered
his mother&#39;s story. Good God, his own father! What
years of affection they would have spent together but
for that mad ferocity of the Commune! How the
one would have helped the other! And the fortune&mdash;he
would have poured it into his father&#39;s lap and
waited for his words of pride. His father&mdash;shot there
in that silent street&mdash;the man whom his mother had
loved as woman rarely has loved in the human story.</p>

<p class="indent">He left the car at the corner by the Catholic Institute
and walked down the Rue d&#39;Assas to its junction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
with the Rue de Fleurus. Naturally, the condition
of things had altered very much, and there were
many new buildings in the vicinity. He discovered
certain landmarks, but others had vanished into the
limbo of the municipal gods and trim modern &quot;blocks&quot;
had taken their places. For all that, he believed that
he could identify the actual house in which these
things had happened, and when he had located it, he
knocked upon the door, and was answered by a trim
old woman, who seemed much put out at the occurrence.
Bertie Morris was quite equal to such an occasion.
&quot;Give her five francs,&quot; he said. It was done
immediately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who lives here now, madame?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur Brocas, the advocate&mdash;for many years,
he and his mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he at home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is at Lyons, m&#39;sieur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And madame?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is in the south.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This gentleman with me is an American. His
father and mother lived here forty years ago&mdash;before
the war. Naturally, he would very much like to see
the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is his name, m&#39;sieur?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber told her himself, and the tone of his voice
seemed to awaken memories. She began to mumble
something in the argot of the &quot;Boul. Mich,&quot; and then
bade him come in. The room clearly belonged to
people who were fond of books when at home, and
neglectful of them when away. It was all very untidy
and dusty; the furniture handsome, but shown to poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
advantage. The very first thing Faber set his hand
upon was a volume of Hawthorne&#39;s &quot;House of the
Seven Gables.&quot; His father&#39;s name was written beneath
an English book-plate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell her,&quot; he said to Morris, &quot;that this was once
my father&#39;s property.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not seem at all interested, but she avoided
their glances nevertheless, and seemed strangely afraid
of them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You understand?&quot; said Faber at last. &quot;My father&#39;s
book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She nodded and answered him, to his surprise, in
broken but comprehensible English.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was your mother&#39;s servant three years, m&#39;sieur&mdash;a
very little child. I am nearly sixty years old, but
my memory is good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You remember my father, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I remember him! Do children forget such
things?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you here when he died, madame?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She clasped her hands together almost as one in
prayer. Her voice was a sing-song, like that of a
child reciting a learned lesson.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was at nine o&#39;clock on the Friday night. Ah!
what a day, m&#39;sieur! There had been cannon since
the Sunday, and the streets full of mad people. I
looked down from my window and saw the dead carried
away. I was cold with a child&#39;s curiosity. When
night came, m&#39;sieur would not dine. He had been
out all day helping the wounded, and all he would take
was a little soup and wine. Then he went out again
while madame and I were up in the front room watching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
the fires burn and listening to the cannon. M&#39;sieur,
the heavens opened that night! My soul shrank at
the sight; I thought the end of the world had come.
And I was but a child, and had lived such a little
while.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She paused and breathed almost convulsively, as
though suffering the terrible hours again. Faber
watched her without flinching. His swift imagination
moved out there in the streets where his father
worked amid the wounded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And afterwards, madame&mdash;afterwards?&quot; said Bertie
Morris in French.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up at him almost angrily, the thread of
the inspiration of memory broken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is so many years ago, m&#39;sieur. I remember
badly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber stepped across the room and laid his hand
upon her arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did my father die, madame? Remember, I
am his son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So very like him, m&#39;sieur; he seems to stand beside
me once more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You remember the night&mdash;you cannot have forgotten
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no; it is all here. The heart knows, but the
tongue will not speak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you see him when they brought him in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She quivered, as though the scene had been yester-night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;M&#39;sieur, it passed so swiftly&mdash;death came to
him while he walked. I saw Captain d&#39;Arny upon a
white horse&mdash;I heard m&#39;sieur&#39;s voice&mdash;how well I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
knew it! Then someone spoke in anger, a rifle was
fired, madame ran from me, her tears choking her
so that she could not speak to me. They brought
monsieur in and laid him on the sofa; your hand is
touching it now. I remember that his hand was in
madame&#39;s, his eyes hurt by the bright light of the
chandelier. He begged for a little wine and I went
to the buffet; my hand shook, and I could not open
the bottle. When we had found a glass m&#39;sieur was
dead. How shall I tell you more?&mdash;m&#39;sieur was dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice died down almost to a whisper; none
of the others spoke for some minutes. It was still
snowing, and a black cloud was over the city. Faber
thought that it must have been just such a day when
the Versaillese, drunk with victory, entered the Rue
de Fleurus and found his father there.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of them still lived and remembered the night.
General d&#39;Arny was such a one, and they were to
meet to-morrow.</p>

<p class="center">IV</p>

<p class="indent">At the Ritz Hotel a few hours later, Bertie Morris
studied a fine company with a critic&#39;s eye. He knew
most of the people in the famous <i>salle √† manger</i>, and
put himself up several pegs on the strength of his
knowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, there are some glad frocks&mdash;what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber, who had a little bundle of papers in his hand,
looked round and about for the first time. &quot;All
friends of yours?&quot; he asked slyly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
Bertie showed a row of gold-rimmed teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Know most of them. Newspaper people must.
That&#39;s young Mrs. Vanderbilt; the Countess Sobenski&#39;s
next to her. Of course, you recognize Steel&mdash;and
the Great Man. He&#39;s as good as he&#39;s great&mdash;a
hundred and forty papers and more than one Cabinet
Minister pretty fond of him. Beyond him is Sir
Charles. Did you ever hear him speak? About the
best hindleg man they&#39;ve got over yonder. Oughtn&#39;t
to have been an actor&mdash;he&#39;d have run Canterbury better.
Who the next lot are, can&#39;t say. The flaxen-haired
one is a d&mdash;&mdash;d fine girl&mdash;I don&#39;t think. Wonder
who she is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber smiled. &quot;She&#39;s a parson&#39;s daughter&mdash;no
good to you. There&#39;s Sir Jules Achon and his daughter,
but who the little girl in black may be, I don&#39;t
know; she looks like a French girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll ask Ellis; he&#39;s a &#39;Who&#39;s Who&#39; here. Fine
chap, Ellis, ought to have got the K.G.G. when he
was in London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the K.G.G. anyway?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Knight of the Grand Gorge&mdash;two pots crossed
and a tumbler rampant. Puts Pommery in your
thoughts. Suppose we do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber gave the order and the wine was served.
Accustomed to the immense hotels of New York, he
found the Ritz interesting chiefly by reason of its
guests. The women were magnificently gowned, and
many of them very pretty. Such a cosmopolitan company
could hardly be found in any other hotel on the
Continent; its united wealth would have financed a
kingdom. Faber reflected with satisfaction that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
had the right to be there. His brains had earned him
the title.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About this parson&#39;s daughter,&quot; Bertie asked;
&quot;what&#39;s she doing in such a place as this?&quot; He had
grown curious, for Gabrielle Silvester was quite the
most beautiful woman in the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She appears to be eating at present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know; but who are her friends?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The man is Sir Jules Achon. He&#39;s a big man&mdash;those
who come after will hear of him. Have you
read nothing of the Federation of Europe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not as much as the top dot of a semicolon. Who&#39;s
going to federate?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s his own idea. Kill war by commerce&mdash;you
can&#39;t kill it any other way. Europe&#39;s paying ten per
cent taxation as against America for her armies and
navies. Make one federated state with no commercial
barriers, and you knock the ten per cent down to two.
That&#39;s Sir Jules&#39;s notion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything in it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So much that if I was British born, I&#39;d give him
a headline in dollars which would set the town talking.
There&#39;s everything in it except the men. He&#39;s got
the German Emperor, and he&#39;ll get the Tsar. It&#39;s the
smaller fry who don&#39;t listen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Venus with the tow-coloured topknot seems
to be in that boat. She&#39;s looking at you all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you quarrel with her taste?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; but you know her pretty well, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An impertinent question. She came over on the
ship with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
&quot;And wants to go back the same way&mdash;eh, what?
Well, I&#39;d like to interview Sir Jules anyway. There
ought to be a column story in him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he ought to be worth fifty dollars.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you say he&#39;d got the German Emperor?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand that&#39;s so; he&#39;s going down to Corfu
to see him again. He&#39;ll get the thing through if I
don&#39;t upset it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should you upset it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rattle up your brains and see the reason. I&#39;m
here to sell guns. While that man is dangling about
an anteroom, kow-towing to menials, I shall be inside
with the chief. It&#39;s common sense. I&#39;m here to do
business&mdash;he&#39;s here to prevent that kind of business
being done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he going to take the peerless Saxon with him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You seem rather hot on that scent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A d&mdash;&mdash;d fine woman! Look at her arms! She&#39;s
got a style you don&#39;t often find among Englishwomen.
I can&#39;t see her feet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask the waiter to take away the table.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll bet she takes fives. Her eyes are of the &#39;get
there&#39; sort. Can&#39;t you feel her looking this way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not conscious of any rise of temperature. If
you&#39;ve done looking, perhaps we&#39;ll smoke. They&#39;ll
be coming out immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you&#39;ll introduce me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! I didn&#39;t say that. Is it brandy or K√ºmmel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, brandy&mdash;if you&#39;ve got to talk to women.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They passed out into the corridor, and sat there
near the band. The place was deliciously warm; it
glowed with soft lights, and was redolent of the odours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
of flowers. Superbly dressed women rustled by them;
men, who had dined well, lurched past with their
hands in their pockets and cigarettes in their mouths.
The Hungarians played one of Lehar&#39;s waltzes&mdash;a
scene of colour and of life reflecting the holy of social
holies and of the almighty dollar. Presently Sir Jules
Achon came out, followed by the three girls. Now,
Faber recognised the third. She was Claudine d&#39;Arny,
General d&#39;Arny&#39;s daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">The party was almost gone by before Gabrielle
discovered him. She turned at once and held out her
gloved hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The wager,&quot; she said, looking at him very earnestly;
&quot;I appear to have lost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there&#39;s nothing to pay anyway. Are you
going through to the yacht?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, to Naples. Sir Jules wishes me to see Italy
and then the Adriatic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Full of pirates and wild men,&quot; said Eva Achon,
who was by Gabrielle&#39;s side. &quot;We shall all be carried
away to a cave.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t know they had so much taste. How do
you do, Sir Jules?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Jules was a little man with a wonderful head.
He was sixty-four years old, but had the intellectual
energy of a man of twenty. The East and the West
were strangely blended in a countenance full of power
and quiet dignity. A softer voice Faber had never
heard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, Mr. Faber. And you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Always well&mdash;on paper. You are going through
to Italy, I hear&mdash;you&#39;ll catch the Emperor, I think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
&quot;I hope so. The promises encourage me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the performances will be better. Any old
fool of a minister can promise; it is a king who performs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have read my pamphlet, Mr. Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Every line&mdash;the greatest peace scheme&mdash;I was
going to say, on earth. I&#39;ll change that: Out of
heaven&#39;s nearer it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, it must come slowly, if it comes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the best things come slowly. Man was about
a million years about before he thought of microbes&mdash;this
is a great affair; none greater. It would be
the coup of the century if you brought it off. There
could be nothing greater.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope to do so. Are you staying here long?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As many hours as it will take me to teach a man
my name. I may be at Corfu myself afterwards. I&#39;m
imitating you, and buying a yacht.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The one luxury in the world&mdash;get a good one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There won&#39;t be any better when I begin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The group passed on; Faber shook hands with Eva,
but not with Claudine d&#39;Arny. When Gabrielle&#39;s turn
came, he held her hand in his for a brief instant and
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, how&#39;s the I.A.L.?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Waiting for your name,&quot; she replied. But she
did not withdraw her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you give me the top of the bill?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In gold and purple.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And printed on fine linen? Well, I&#39;m not
tempted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The day will come&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
He laughed and dropped her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s Booth, the actor. Well, most of you are
play-acting, anyway. Good-night, Miss Silvester,
don&#39;t forget what I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed and spoke in a lower tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will remind you of it at Corfu,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">The men watched them down the corridor before
Bertie Morris became eloquent. He was not a little
piqued that the girls had ignored him, while even Sir
Jules had regarded him as one regards an ugly piece
of china in a glass-case. A poor tribute, he thought,
to the might of the pen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; said Faber.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A d&mdash;&mdash;d fine girl, but cold as marble!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What makes you think so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Voice, gesture, everything. Give her a chance,
and she&#39;d be up on a platform spouting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think so. She&#39;s going to have many
chances. What about the others?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old man&#39;s daughter is just a bread-and-butter
miss. I liked little Claudine d&#39;Arny&mdash;as ugly as sin,
but passion enough for a nautch girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You remind me of her father. See here: I had
a letter from him to-day. What would happen to-morrow
if I published it&mdash;by accident? Here&#39;s a
note of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie read it carelessly; then with a journalistic
interest:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you published that&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or you did&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Same thing&mdash;I guess he&#39;d be out of Paris in four-and-twenty
hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
&quot;Ah, then I mustn&#39;t publish it&mdash;don&#39;t you be playing
any journalistic tricks on me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think,&quot; said Bertie Morris.</p>

<p class="indent">And their eyes met.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-5" id="ch1-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">GENERAL D&#39;ARNY AND HIS DAUGHTER</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">General d&#39;Arny lived in an old house in the Boulevard
St. Germain, one of the few monuments still
existing to the golden age of R√©camier and the salons.
He did not care a scudo for the literary and artistic
associations of this gloomy mansion, but much for the
fact that he paid little rent. Beaumarchais had lived
there on the eve of his flight to Holland; the great
rooms had known Fleury and his fellows, Balzac and
Saint-Beuve&mdash;a very panel of genius written across
the centuries.</p>

<p class="indent">It all meant very little to Hubert d&#39;Arny, the bulk
of whose fortune went into the trough at Panama; the
residue into the hands of the jobbers on the Bourse.
The general was notoriously a financial derelict; as
notoriously a suspect to his many enemies in the
Chamber.</p>

<p class="indent">He had married late in life&mdash;some years after the
war&mdash;and his wife died in childbirth. One daughter,
Claudine, was alternately the object of a maudlin
affection and of sentimental regret. She cost a great
deal of money, and had the indecency to arrive at a
marriageable age. When Captain Issy-Ferrault, a son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
of one of the oldest aristocracies in France, came forward,
the general assented in spite of his democratic
principles. The business of providing for the girl
aged him pathetically. The newspapers said it was
Morocco; but the trouble lay much nearer home.</p>

<p class="indent">As it chanced, John Faber arrived in Paris in the
midst of the preparations for Claudine&#39;s wedding. He
knew nothing of it; no one had guessed that he had
any interest in the daughter of the French Minister
of Artillery, or she in him. Claudine went to America
at the invitation of the French Ambassador, whose
children were her friends. When Faber was introduced
to her upon the ship, she said frankly that she
did not like him. His manners were <i>gauche</i>, and his
eyes inquisitive. She avoided him with a sure instinct,
being ignorant that he knew anything of her or her
family. This was a great misfortune, for she had
many qualities which appeal to men, and Faber was
not the kind of man to remain insensible to them.</p>

<p class="indent">In Paris, upon her return, she entered the promised
land of preparation. The general swore loudly while
he signed the cheques, but signed them none the less.
Dressmakers flocked to the Boulevard St. Germain,
and their mouths were full of pins. Claudine was of
a romantic temperament, but it could stoop to laces
and fine linen. She argle-bargled with her father like
a wench at a fair, and when he discounted the list,
she declared that she would not be married at all.
A scandal was the potent weapon in her armament.
He could not have a scandal.</p>

<p class="indent">This extravagance of idea filled her bedroom to
overflowing; to say nothing of other bedrooms. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
would sit curled up amid a tangle of the most delicate
draperies&mdash;transparencies which should have come
from a fairy godmother; masterpieces in velvets and
satins&mdash;she would wonder if life were long enough to
wear them all. These things were hidden in her virgin
holy of holies, but she ticked off the days which shut
the door against the One Unknown, and often fell to
a young girl&#39;s awe in the presence of the mysteries.
Then came the last night of all&mdash;the maids had left
her; the house was at rest. A dirty fluff of snow fell
upon the streets of Paris. She was to be married at
St. Eustache to-morrow!</p>

<p class="indent">Claudine undressed herself, and putting on the most
wonderful of lace robes, she sat before a fire of wood
and warmed her pink and white feet at the blaze.
There should have been regrets at the life she was
leaving: she might have dwelt with some affection
upon her passing girlhood, and the home which had
sheltered her. But she did nothing of the kind. Her
thoughts were entirely devoted to St. Eustache and
afterwards. What an exciting day it must be! Every
friend she had would be in the church. One of the
canons was to marry them, and afterwards there would
be a great feast and many speeches in the old ballroom
downstairs. At four in the afternoon, Justin&#39;s
motor-car was to take them to the old ch√¢teau, near
Rambouillet, where the first week was to be spent.
She pictured the lonely drive over the whitened roads,
through the forests&mdash;then the ch√¢teau, grim, old and
moated. They would dine together&mdash;and then&mdash;then
she would know what love was!</p>

<p class="indent">Her ideas were truly French, and English sentiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
could have offered them little sympathy. Perhaps
Captain Issy-Ferrault stood to her less for <i>the</i>
man than for <i>a</i> man. She had been educated in convents
where saintly women shuddered at the mere
footsteps of their common enemy and provoked a
thousand curiosities by their very holiness. Then had
come a few short years of the world&mdash;it had taught
Claudine that all life began from the hour when a man
first took a woman into his arms and the Church
blessed the proceeding. Afterwards there were other
things. The first step was sufficient for her vigil that
night.</p>

<p class="indent">Her wedding dress had been laid upon a little bed
in the adjoining room. She went there on tip-toe as
though afraid that someone might spy upon her while
she touched the satin and laces with delighted fingers.
Strong scents perfumed the room and the odour of
blossoms. Claudine went and stood before a long
mirror of the wardrobe and studied herself in many
attitudes. She did not know whether she was really
pretty. Justin, her fianc√©, had paid her many compliments,
and she tried to believe them. A greater source
of encouragement was her figure&mdash;the fine rounded
limbs, the pink and white of a young girl&#39;s skin. For
an instant she remembered the ordeal of discovery
which awaited her to-morrow; then with a light laugh,
she returned to her bedroom. Other brides had suffered
and survived&mdash;she took courage.</p>

<p class="indent">The priest had told her to say many things in her
prayers&mdash;good man, he said them in his&mdash;but they
were clean gone from her head at this time. The
girlish romance of an English wedding was not for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
her. No gifts of sweet and silent hours were hers.
She knew very little of Justin&mdash;he, less of her. He
had kissed her but twice, and then apologetically. Yet
to-morrow she would be his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">Stay, but was it to-morrow? She listened at the
window and counted the church bells chiming the hour.</p>

<p class="indent">Twelve o&#39;clock.</p>

<p class="indent">Her wedding was to-day.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">The afternoon of the same day had found General
d&#39;Arny closeted with John Faber in a little room in
the Avenue de l&#39;Op√©ra. Here was the Paris agency
of the great Charleston Company, and hither came
d&#39;Arny at his own suggestion.</p>

<p class="indent">A bent old man, not lacking dignity in a common
way&mdash;dignity had gone to the journalistic dogs that
afternoon. He entered the office trembling with excitement;
he could not speak for some minutes, and
when he did so, his tones rolled like thunder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is finished,&quot; he said. &quot;Read!&quot; And he held
out a paper with quivering fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber watched him with half-closed eyes. He was
thinking of another day, when this man, a mere captain
of the Chasseurs-√†-Cheval then, had ridden down
the Rue de Fleurus and commanded his men to hunt
out the Communards. Some forty years ago, and no
doubt the soldier had forgotten every hour of it.
None the less, the sword of destiny was poised and
would fall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall I read?&quot; Faber rejoined, after a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
spell of waiting. He knew every word his friend Bertie
Morris had cabled to America, but his face was
void of knowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some talk of the deal,&quot; he ran on. &quot;Well, I guess
we expect it. Why should they keep quiet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The soldier pulled himself together, and taking the
paper from the outstretched hand, he began to turn
the leaves quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is on page 3,&quot; he said. &quot;Yes, that is it, if you
would be good enough to read.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The clock ticked in a silent room for some minutes.
Faber read the article to the end without moving a
muscle of his usually expressive face. A great business
man is often a great actor. He was one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There seems to have been a leakage,&quot; he said presently,
and then, looking up, &quot;Whom do you suspect?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suspect! God in Heaven, what has suspicion
to do with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should have thought you were in the way of it&mdash;that
is, if you take it seriously this side.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old man wormed with impatience.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The <i>Soir</i> has it; there will not be a paper in Paris
without it to-morrow. Do you not see that it is, in
effect, the letter I wrote to you on Tuesday last?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who&#39;s to blame for that? I told you at the beginning
not to write.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it to be imagined that you cannot receive letters?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber leaned over the table, and began to speak
with some warmth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See here,&quot; he said, &quot;you&#39;re a Minister of Artillery
in Paris. You receive, I suppose, some three or four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
hundred letters a day? Can you be responsible for
them all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But this was sent to you privately at your hotel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A foolish kind of letter at the best&mdash;I remember
every word of it. You admit in so many words that
our deal is for forty thousand francs, and stipulate
that Captain Clearnay must have ten. Why couldn&#39;t
you come round to me and say so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was three times at the hotel that day; you were
absent on each occasion. It was urgent that Clearnay
should be dealt with if the contract was to go
through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly what this newspaper man says. He calls it
a second Ollivier case, I see. Well, I shouldn&#39;t wonder
if it made as much noise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">D&#39;Arny tortured himself into new attitudes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God!&quot; he cried. &quot;Don&#39;t you see my position?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perfectly. I saw it from the beginning. You&#39;ll
have to leave Paris awhile.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then the contract is lost?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never thought it would go through, General. I
wasn&#39;t such a d&mdash;&mdash;d fool.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But at least a word from you will save my name.
You can deny the letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could deny it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you wishing to tell me that there is any
doubt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt at all. Unfortunately, it was read, by
mistake, in the Hotel Ritz the night it reached me.
You should see Morris, of the <i>New York Mitre</i>. He
might do something for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
The man rose, white as a sheet and broken. He
may or may not have understood the nature of the
trap into which he had fallen, but it was clear to him
that John Faber could or would do little for him. He
went out into the street to be offered a copy of <i>La
Gu√™pe</i>, and to hear the newsboy cry the latest news
of this surpassing jobbery.</p>

<p class="indent">A less consummate artist than Faber would have
spoken of the Rue de Fleurus, and of what happened
there forty years ago. Hubert d&#39;Arny had not the
remotest notion that the man who had ruined him was
the son of that American citizen who had been shot by
his orders at the crisis of the great debacle.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">Paris licked its lips over the scandal, and then stood
aghast.</p>

<p class="indent">The tragedy surpassed all expectation, and yet all
admitted that there was no other course.</p>

<p class="indent">Hubert d&#39;Arny was found dead in a little hotel at
Passy that very night. He had blown out his brains
upon the eve of his daughter&#39;s wedding. People
thought rather of Claudine than of him. Much that
would have been written and said was obliterated or
hushed when she was mentioned. Who would break
it to her? Such a blow had not been struck at the
Republic since the Humbert scandal.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber knew nothing of the coming wedding, and
he heard the news of Hubert d&#39;Arny&#39;s death without
emotion. There were primitive traits in his character
which this affair made dominant. If pity urged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
claims, he thrust them aside when he remembered his
dead father. &quot;An eye for an eye&mdash;and for death, the
dead.&quot; A sense of power and authority nerved his
will and flattered a well-balanced vanity. After all,
his brains and money had won this victory against all
the shining armour of France. He perceived that the
financier was, after all, the most considerable power
in the world to-day. Kings can make war when the
bankers will pay for it. He had been his own general
and his money was his army. A stroke of the
pen had laid one of the most powerful men in Paris
dead at his feet&mdash;as vulgar tragedy would put it. A
mind that had little subtlety and much common sense
rose to no analytical attitudes. He had killed the man
just as a Southerner shoots down a nigger&mdash;and of
the two the nigger was perhaps the more deserving.</p>

<p class="indent">In this frame of mind, he was greatly astonished
to receive a visit from Gabrielle Silvester very early
on the following morning. He had even forgotten
that she knew anything of his dealings with General
d&#39;Arny, nor did he immediately connect her with the
tragedy of which all Paris was talking. She had come
to tell him that the yacht was sailing, he thought; then
he noticed that she did not offer him her hand, while
her manner toward him was utterly changed&mdash;a chill
womanly manner he could not mistake.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why!&quot; he said. &quot;Still in Paris?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She avoided the question, and went straight to the
heart of the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have come to ask you, Mr. Faber, if you knew
that Claudine d&#39;Arny was to have been married to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
He stepped back a pace and looked her full in the
face. Rarely in his life had he flinched before man
or woman, but the accusation stunned him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was I aware? But how should I be aware?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She drew nearer, her face aflame and her heart beating
wildly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must know this&mdash;please bear with me. I must
have your answer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has been given you. I knew nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed dazed and not a little helpless now.
Seating herself upon the edge of a chair near the fireplace,
she began to speak her thoughts aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The secret is yours and mine. I would have told
nobody. For you, it must be a hard thought to the
end of your life. She was to have been married to-day.
Will you tell me that if you had known it, it
would have made a difference?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He debated that, standing with his hands in his
pockets, but his face grave enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing would have made any difference between
that man and me. He shot my father. Very well&mdash;he
had to pay, sooner or later. But I don&#39;t think it
would have been to-day, if I had known.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was silent a little while. Then she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can think of nothing but such simple things.
If I had stopped to tell you in the hall of the hotel&mdash;just
that&mdash;there would not have been to-day! It was
one of those chances that do not recur. I thought
everyone knew that Claudine was to be married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The last thing a man knows about any woman who
is a mere acquaintance. Have you seen her to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shivered.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
&quot;I dare not go&mdash;I dare not!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has relatives in Paris?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose so&mdash;friends would put her to shame.
Does it matter when he is dead?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was a rogue, or I would have spared him. He
tried to cheat me from the start. I found nothing I
could fix upon&mdash;and I looked for it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She would not consider it from that point of view.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This will always be in your life and Claudine&#39;s.
Time cannot alter judgments of this kind. It will
grow with the years. I am very sorry for you, Mr.
Faber.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He resented it; the patronage of women rarely
failed to anger him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leave me to my own affairs. I take the responsibility.
I&#39;ve taken a good many in my time. The
girl&#39;s to be thought of. Who was she going to marry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Captain Issy-Ferrault. I hardly know him: an
officer of cavalry, they say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor, I suppose, as most of the kind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When will she marry him now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, surely, you understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand one thing: he&#39;s going to marry her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A child would know that it&#39;s impossible!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I am wiser than a child. Will you let me
have his address&mdash;to-morrow, say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am leaving Paris to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then one of my clerks will get it. Shall we meet
at Corfu?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she said. &quot;I came to tell you
that I never wished to see you again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
&quot;You haven&#39;t told me so. It shall be at Corfu.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not answer or hold out her hand. He knew
that a barrier had risen up between them and his
pride was quickened.</p>

<p class="indent">He would marry this woman because she had
judged him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-1" id="ch2-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">A RACE FOR AN EMPEROR</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">There were two yachts on the Adriatic Sea waiting
for an emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">One lay in the harbour of Fiume; the other at Trieste.
The emperor himself was still at Potsdam, and
none of the newspapers seemed to know when he
would sail.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Jules Achon was a man of infinite patience and
superb tenacity. Few but his intimate friends knew
much about him. He had amassed a great fortune as
a shipbroker, and now with advancing years, he devoted
the bulk of that fortune to this tremendous
project of European Federation. Yet it was all done
without any claptrap whatever. The newspapers had
hardly heard of it. There was no writer of eminence
to take it up. Sir Jules worked in great places,
but he worked silently. Already his scheme had the
approval of kings and emperors. He had gone to St.
Petersburg with a recommendation to the English Ambassador
which opened all doors. But for a dramatic
accident of destiny, the Tsar would have been his first
patron. Three ministers knew his scheme, and two
of them were warm supporters of such a transcendent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
project. The third saw in it a danger to the diplomatists,
which self interest could not tolerate. &quot;This will
make an end of us,&quot; he had said. Sir Jules agreed
that it was so. That very night Ivolsky obtained an
audience of the Emperor, and besought him to withdraw
his patronage. The others were too late by a
few hours, and who shall say how far that accident
of time and space has affected the immediate destinies
of Europe?</p>

<p class="indent">For the common peace projects, beating of pacific
drums and waving of fraternal flags, Sir Jules cared
not at all. He believed that international peace could
come only upon a basis of common European interests.
His scheme would have established free trade
between the kingdoms. Wars arise chiefly from commercial
disputes; commercial disputes are the first
fruits of tariffs. Let the commercial incentive be
wanting and disarmament may begin. A gradual
process needed many years for full attainment&mdash;but
it could begin to-morrow if the conditions were fulfilled.</p>

<p class="indent">He talked very little of all this to those with him
on the yacht. It was, in effect, a young people&#39;s party
and a merry one at that. Dr. Joe Burrall had come
from Putney, a braw man of thirty, who had rowed
for Cambridge. Douglas Renshaw, a gunner whose
occupation had gone, came because he was asked, and
was asked because he was sure to come. He had taken
to the Stock Exchange recently as a wire-haired terrier
to the gorse, and Sir Jules had put a small fortune
into his pocket. He knew a little geology, and
declared his intention of studying Slav. So far the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
only word he had picked up was &quot;hijar,&quot; and he was
not very sure to what tongue it belonged, though he
used it frequently as an expression of joy.</p>

<p class="indent">These two with Gabrielle Silvester were the guests
of Sir Jules and his daughter upon the <i>Wanderer</i>, the
fine steam yacht which had so often invaded the superb
mysteries of the Western Mediterranean. They
understood their host&#39;s ambitions, but rarely spoke
of them. When it was learned that there was a doubt
about the Emperor going to Corfu after all, they
looked upon it as a personal rebuff, but did not discuss
it except apart. All kinds of excursions kept
them busy. They visited the unsurpassable islands of
the Adriatic, became learned about Zara and Sebenico
and matchless Ragusa, the incomparable Republic, defying
East and West alike during the centuries. Local
interests attracted them; they saw much of these
savage peoples; were ashore for many a frolic; lived
in a blaze of sunshine and an atmosphere wholly medieval.</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle&#39;s voyage to America had been her first
world experience beyond the walls of meticulous suburbia.
This new adventure fascinated her beyond
measure. She felt that she had really begun to live.
It were as though the passion of the East stirred in
her normally cold blood and left her panting. Destiny
had snatched her up from the ruck to put her in high
places. Far from surrendering to the enervating suggestions
of this sunny sea, they forced her mind to
considerable ambitions&mdash;and with them all the name of
John Faber would associate itself despite the memories.
This was contrary to all she had determined in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
Paris, and put her to some shame. She felt that she
had no right to see such a man again, that he was a
social pariah, without pity or any title to the meanest
respect. And yet he would creep into the scheme of
her ambitions, and she understood in some way that
without him they were meaningless.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">It was a great surprise to Gabrielle when the launch
returned to the yacht one afternoon in the second
week in December with her father and Harry Lassett
on board. This was one of Sir Jules&#39; great surprises&mdash;one
in which Eva had a part. Silvester was very
tired after his long journey across Europe, but Harry
was very full of it. They were greeted by Douglas
Renshaw with a &quot;hijar&quot;; by Sir Jules with that quiet
smile which betokened pleasure in the company of his
friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had no idea you could get away,&quot; he said, &quot;or
I would have asked you in London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester said that he had no idea of it either; an
American had come over from Yonkers and was taking
his services for a fortnight. Harry admitted that
for his part he could always get away, which, as Joe
Burrall remarked, was an advantage as useful in debt
as in matrimony.</p>

<p class="indent">This was a sunny day, an ideal day of southern
winter, and they all took tea beneath the awning of
the promenade deck. With Harry, Gabrielle was a
little constrained and uneasy. She was glad to have
him there, and yet felt that in some way his presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
was a douche upon her schemes. He spoke of the
little world of outer London, not of the wider horizon
to which she looked. She had built a tower of her
imagination which Harry Lassett would never climb.
Indeed, he would have derided it as he had done her
American friendship. With her father it was different.
She had a long talk with him in his cabin before
dinner and she learned again how much importance
he had attached to her diplomatic success with John
Faber.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would send me to Yonkers with better credentials
than any Englishman ever carried across the
seas,&quot; he said. &quot;Think of it&mdash;John Faber with us!
The man who has done more than anyone alive to
make war possible in our time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will never get him, father. It would be a
great wrong against the truth if he came in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should it be wrong, Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For many reasons. He believes that all our dreams
are sentimental moonshine; he never could be in earnest&mdash;how
should he be when he does not believe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it not possible to put our view so convincingly
that he must believe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are we convinced ourselves? Is it very real to
us?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very real to me. I think it must be to every
man of culture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How many that would exclude. Nelson could not
have been a man of culture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked up, pained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Faber has been talking to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I have been talking to myself. I think with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
you that war is a very great crime against humanity,
but, after all, God allows it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He sighed and began to sort out his papers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is a great deal which seems to be permitted.
It is another way of saying that mankind has been
left a great work to do. We are fortunate if we are
called to bear the smallest burden. I think disappointments
should be numbered among them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! I agree with you. And, of course, I shall
still hope for Mr. Faber&#39;s name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you think it a wrong, that would be an inconsistency.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not altogether; it might be a great victory. He
is a man with whom you can argue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I hope you will see him again at Corfu.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle did not answer that. Her own words accused
her in some way.</p>

<p class="indent">A great victory! A woman&#39;s victory! What would
that mean in this case? For the moment she let ambition
run away with her and imagination reared fine
castles. They went down with a crash when she heard
Harry Lassett calling her. She made some excuse
and went out&mdash;just as she had gone when Harry called
below her window at Hampstead.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">A superb night with a fine round moon found them
aft upon the deck, gazing over the lights of Fiume to
the vine-clad hills beyond. A wonderful stillness upon
land and water gave place from time to time to sounds
most musical&mdash;the lingering notes of sonorous bells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
the lilt of Italian song, the splash of unseen oars, and
the music of ships. Lanterns shone about them, the
lanterns of steamers at anchor and of the Austrian
fleet. Against a glorious horizon the sails of feluccas
would take fantastic shapes; the stars grouped themselves
in joyous brilliancy. There were many houses
upon the distant hillside and they stood there as beacons,
speaking to the ships and the sea in a tongue
which all understood.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Jules and Silvester were in the smoking-room
at this time having what Harry called &quot;a pow-wow.&quot;
Eva played sentimental themes upon the great organ
in the drawing-room; the doctor and Douglas Renshaw
were ashore for the good of the populace. Gabrielle,
herself, set deep in a deck chair with Harry
Lassett at her feet. He smoked a great pipe and talked
St. Moritz. There had been trouble with his trustees,
and he was not sure he could get out there this year.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So, you see,&quot; he said, &quot;I came along when the old
chap asked me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A most candid way of putting it; there could have
been no other reason in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I say, puss! That&#39;s nasty now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all. To qualify candour is a crime. Well,
you can&#39;t go to St. Moritz. What then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t go. I said that old Ben
Stuart, my trustee, was playing the fox with me. He
says I overdrew a hundred and ninety last year, and
it can&#39;t go on. As if it was his own money!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you disagree with his accounts?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Arithmetic&#39;s no good to me. I was a bit of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
flier at Ananias and Dido at school, but I could add
up a column every time and make it different. I ought
to be Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;eh, what? Surely,
you don&#39;t mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He nestled his head against her knees as though
this kind of comfort were some solatium. Gabrielle
was thinking of John Faber and of what his opinion
would have been of such an admission.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose life isn&#39;t worth living unless you go to
St. Moritz?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He detected no irony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How&#39;s a man to keep fit in our beastly country?&mdash;then,
there&#39;s habit. I believe in doing to-morrow
what you did yesterday&mdash;don&#39;t you? If I stop in
England, it&#39;s covered court tennis, nothing more!
How&#39;s a man to go through the winter on covered
court tennis?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The survival of the fittest. Whatever will become
of you on the yacht?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He puffed stolidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s vegetation. I can lie on my back with
any man&mdash;I&#39;m a plus two at it. A man&#39;s year should
include a month of it. Then I&#39;m orderly; I know
just what I&#39;m going to do during the next two seasons,
as sure as the moon and stars: cricket, four
months; two months&#39; shooting; a bit of hunting if
I can get it in, and if I can&#39;t, then some pat ball on
the links. What more do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you putting the question to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn&#39;t&mdash;but I will!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I should want a lot more: to begin with, a
definite object.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
&quot;Ah, you&#39;re a girl. My opinion of men with definite
objects is that they are generally bores.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the country would not get on without them,
would it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t believe such nonsense, puss. Who&#39;s the
greater man: Asquith or Foster? Would you sooner
be Lloyd George or Bobs? Who&#39;s doing more for
England&mdash;the man who helps to beat the Australians,
or the lawyers who put threepence on the income tax?
You ask the average man, and see what he says.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The average man has not much brains; he is the
servant in the house of intellect. I should never consult
him about anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Puss, I know what you&#39;re thinking about&mdash;it&#39;s that
popgun man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather inconsequent, isn&#39;t it? You wouldn&#39;t average
Mr. Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I suppose he&#39;s clever enough. He makes
money. Old Baker, our head at school, always used
to say that the faculty of making money was one of
the most contemptible. But it&#39;s useful, I admit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, we all admit that, and show our contempt
of the faculty by worshipping the possessor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you worship John Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Collectively, yes; individually, not at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He thought upon it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you had a jolly time with him in Paris?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my dear Harry, what next? I saw him twice:
once in the corridor of the hotel, then in his own
rooms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In his rooms!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; to tell him I never wished to see him again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
&quot;Oh, you brick; that&#39;s the best thing I&#39;ve heard.
Of course, I knew you would. There&#39;s never been
anything said, but you owed that to me&mdash;now, didn&#39;t
you, puss?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She would not answer him. They passed to the
vague intimacies of an incomplete amour, in which
their whispers were inaudible and the sound of
voices in the cabin a warning discord. Eva still played
an intolerable waltz. The harbour waves sported
about the dinghy, tethered astern. Gabrielle wondered
why it was that she was incapable of resisting
all this; that she suffered this quite brainless boy to
kiss her at his pleasure&mdash;a great bear with fearsome
limbs cuddling her. Was it because of her twenty-three
years of Suburbia? Because of an inherited
instinct for the commonplace of the natural life&mdash;such
a life as all about her lived, and would live in
that little world of Hampstead? Or was it purely the
call of sex&mdash;more potent than a thousand theories, imperious
beyond all the laws of emperors and kings?</p>

<p class="indent">The latter thought did not occur to her. She suffered
the spell of the scene, the soft airs of night, the
shining stars, the harbour lights, the waxing and waning
chords of distant music. Harry&#39;s passionate whispers
were like a message from afar. She submitted
to him as though thus was her destiny written.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-2" id="ch2-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">LOUIS DE PALEOLOGUE</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">Do you know Ragusa&mdash;Ragusa, the Pearl of the
Adriatic?</p>

<p class="indent">It was here that the Imperial yacht carried the
Emperor when at last he sailed from Trieste&mdash;here
that John Faber saw him within three hours of his
going ashore.</p>

<p class="indent">Here also Faber found the man he had sought so
many years. Louis de Paleologue, who had taken his
mother to America after his father&#39;s death in Paris.</p>

<p class="indent">Ragusa&mdash;what city is like to this of all that border
the incomparable shore? Sebenico, Zara, Spalato&mdash;who
cares if they perish while Ragusa remains?</p>

<p class="indent">Consider how through the centuries this little republic
shut the gates of her sanctuary in the face
alike of Moslem and of Christian; how she defied now
the Turk, now the Servian, even the mighty power of
Venice at its zenith. Neither friend nor foe coming
to her for shelter was refused. She protected Stephen
Nemanja, who fought her allies of the Byzantine Empire;
she opened her gates to Queen Margarita, and
defended them against the King of Dalmatia. The
&quot;winged lion&quot; writes no shame upon her citadel. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
fell at last, not to man, but to the very earth which
opened and swallowed her up. There was never a
history of Ragusa after that fateful year 1667. The
great earthquake ended a story&mdash;Napoleon wrote but
a sorry epitaph.</p>

<p class="indent">What a cosmopolitan company is that which gathers
every day within the tremendous walls of this
fallen citadel. All the colours of the Balkan peoples
are to be seen here&mdash;the flag and turban of the Turk;
the white breeches of the Albanian&mdash;Joseph&#39;s coat
upon the back of the son of the Black Mountain.
Servians are here: Bosnians and men of Herzegovina;
Italians who have drifted down from northern
towns; Austrians in possession. Crimson clashes with
the sky-blue tunics of the Austrian officers&mdash;there are
deep reds and glowing tints of orange&mdash;all moving in
kaleidoscopic splendour through streets which the extended
arms may measure; by churches and palaces,
which are matchless in their art. A city girded by the
libidinous foliage of the south; a city of half-lights
and shaded cloisters; of a fortress running out into
the blue Adriatic, lifting mighty walls to the caress of
the kindly seas.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">Louis de Paleologue had taken up his abode in a
veritable hole in the wall near the Dominican monastery.
The place was dark and cavernous, and
might have been (but for its monstrous stones) a
booth in an Eastern bazaar. When he worked it was
in the cool of the monastery gardens, the monks stealing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
looks over his shoulder at wonderful forms in bewitching
<i>n√©glig√©</i>&mdash;or even at terpsichoreal advertisements
of pills and powder. For despite his sixty-two
years, and the fact that he was a prince in his own
country, Louis still earned his living by the advertisers,
and was held to be the cleverest draughtsman
at the business.</p>

<p class="indent">One grievance he had, and one joy&mdash;his daughter
Maryska, nineteen upon her last birthday, and still a
child. Maryska like her father (and another celebrity
who has had a statue raised to him) never grew up.
She was the youngest woman of nineteen in the whole
wide world, and when father and daughter went for
&quot;a rag&quot; together, it was wonderful that anything at
all was left in the Cantina&mdash;as he had named the
house.</p>

<p class="indent">Such days they passed! Louis, prone in the sun
with a cigarette in his mouth; Maryska, flitting about
the scene like a schoolgirl at play! They went hand
in hand everywhere like sworn friends in an academy
for young ladies. What money they earned would
be sometimes in his pocket, sometimes in hers. They
quarrelled babyishly&mdash;the man shedding tears more
often than the girl. Yet he would have put his knife
into the heart of any who did her injury, with as little
thought as he would have killed a stray dog at his
door. There had been one such tragedy at Zara&mdash;the
body was found in the harbour some days afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska was a cosmopolitan. She had starved in
New York, in London, in Paris, in Berlin. Now she
starved in Ragusa&mdash;except upon those splendid occasions
when a cheque came from England. Then the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
Austrian banker would be fetched out of bed or caf√©
to cash it. They were rare days, for Louis would
knock down the bottles like ninepins, and never turn
a hair whatever their number. Maryska drank just
as much as she could, and then fell asleep. He used
to shout and swear because she would not wake up to
draw another cork for him.</p>

<p class="indent">Latterly, it had been the devil to pay at the Cantina.
Louis had lived in prospective upon six disorderly
nymphs&mdash;all d√©collet√©&mdash;who were to have proclaimed
the merits, <i>urbi et orbi</i>, of a new suspender for ladies
of fashion. These drawings were quite wonderful.
The prior of the monastery who no doubt, may have
imagined that they were part of a scheme for a stained
glass window, thought very highly of them. The Austrian
officers begged for copies of the paper. The
governor laughed and had a fit of coughing. He
wanted to know where the models came from. Louis
would not tell him that, except to say that they were
memories of Paris and New York. He rarely drew
the beautiful dark face of Maryska&mdash;but there is a
portrait of her in the church of St. John the Divine
in London, and many would swear it is a madonna
of an old master. Louis painted it for the priest, who
used to tell him he was a scoundrel. It was so very
true.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, the pictures were drawn and dispatched to
London; and then a dreadful thing happened. The
firm, which understood the female mysteries so well,
treated the financial verities with a contempt which
quickly ended in Carey Street. No cheque came to
that hole in the wall at Ragusa. Squat-legged and patient,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
Louis smoked his cigarette and listened to Maryska&#39;s
wholly unmelodious music. There was bread in
the house, but no wine. Well, wine would come presently.</p>

<p class="indent">Wine did not come, but in its place came John
Faber. For a moment, Louis thought that a customer
had crossed the seas to buy his pictures. Then
he said that the firm, which was suspended because of
its suspenders, had sent an embassy with the cash.
However it might be, he determined to borrow five
crowns of the stranger, and saluted him with princely
politeness.</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska, meanwhile, stood up ready to go to the
wine-shop.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">Faber took off his hat at the entrance to the cavern,
and blinked in the darkness. He saw a handsome man
squatting on the floor, and behind him a pair of eyes
which glowed as a cat&#39;s. They belonged to Maryska;
but he did not know, indeed, he wondered if there
were wild beasts in the place.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, does anyone named Louis de Paleologue live
here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The accent transplanted father and daughter to
New York in an instant. What years they had lived
there! How they regretted them!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He does, sir, and what then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are Mr. Paleologue?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is so. My daughter&mdash;she doesn&#39;t bite&mdash;at
least, only me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
Maryska&#39;s teeth were to be counted on the instant.
She laughed as the Italians laugh, without reservations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Accidenti!</i>&quot; she cried, and then coming out into
the light, &quot;<i>caro mio</i>&mdash;he is too tough, poppa, I should
spoil my teeth!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber saluted her in a way he intended to be Continental.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have been in New York, signorina?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Five years, mister. I am all Americano!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I&#39;ll walk right in, if I may.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He did not wait for permission, but entered the
cavern. It was evident that he would have liked a
chair, but seeing none, he accepted a mat which she
offered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poppa burned all the chairs long ago. Can you
sit down on nothing, mister?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He said that he could, looking at Maryska all the
while. Louis took a box of Bosnian cigarettes from
the floor and passed it over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, are you thirsty, boss?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber smiled at that.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, this is thirsty ground. As the governor
said&mdash;but I guess ye don&#39;t know what the governor&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bet you!&quot; He said. &quot;&#39;Don&#39;t let it be long between
the drinks.&#39; There&#39;s a wine-shop two blocks away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska stepped forward, as keen as a hound. She
held out her hand for the money without any shame
at all&mdash;she and her father had been holding it out
for years&mdash;yet some of Louis&#39; gifts in return had been
more precious than gold.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
&quot;How much shall I give you?&quot; Faber asked. She
replied that a kronen would be ample. He gave it
her, and she was away in a flash.</p>

<p class="indent">They smoked a space in silence when she was gone.
Presently Faber said: &quot;Business good down this way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Louis did not like the tone of it, and the quills of
his pride stiffened. &quot;What&#39;s that to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Might be a good deal&mdash;I&#39;m in dead earnest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s your line&mdash;pills or powder?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m neither. I make guns.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Want me to fire &#39;em off&mdash;well, I&#39;m ready. What&#39;s
the size?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not quite it,&quot; he said; and then wandering right
away from the subject, &quot;I wish I&#39;d known you were
in New York. You didn&#39;t work under your own
name there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s so. I used to sign just &#39;Louis.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you draw me a picture of Maryska&mdash;for my
house? A thousand dollars now and another thousand
when it&#39;s delivered?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Louis drew back a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why the girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must know why. There couldn&#39;t be a better
subject.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; but if I do not choose to do it, what then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, then I&#39;m beaten.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He threw away the stump of his cigarette and took
another. Presently Maryska returned with the flask
of white wine and the glasses were chinked. The
child drank a draught which would have put a vintner
to shame. Then she showed her pretty teeth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
&quot;Oh, how good!&quot; she said, and then with a heavenly
sigh, &quot;<i>Ecco c&#39;e vuoto</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think you could do another?&quot; Faber asked Louis.
The reply was quite stately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir, I am at your disposition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska went off with five crowns this time. When
she was gone, her father thawed a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you seen much of this place?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just as much as the harbour showed me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Staying here long?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, as to that&mdash;why stay?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Paleologue knocked the ashes off his cigarette with
magnificent dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You make guns; why not see some of them go
off?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you suggest fighting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s so. I&#39;m going up to Podgorica in three
days&#39; time, afterwards on to the frontier. There&#39;ll be
riot, rape and pillage. Like to come along?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber was a little nonplussed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you go alone?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The girl and I, certainly. We can talk business
on the road. Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll come! Here&#39;s the wine, I see. She&#39;s a
wonder that girl of yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Louis assented.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her bringing up; she has forgotten how to read
and write. It is education which is the matter nowadays.
I believe the Greeks knew women. Come here,
wild cat, and tell the stranger you can&#39;t read or
write.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska reddened at this and cried &quot;Beast!&quot; with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
real anger. She sulked for quite a long time, hiding
in the dark corner where only her glowing eyes could
be seen. Louis took no notice of her tantrums; he
had begun to be rather interested in the stranger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, you know the fighting may be a bit lively.
I&#39;m bound for Ranovica&mdash;want to see it burned.
There was a man here yesterday from the London
illustrated papers. He&#39;s out for fancy pictures and
put me on. He&#39;s mighty anxious after the rape and
pillage. I guess we&#39;ll see something of that at
Ranovica.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber looked at the girl; she did not seem to be
listening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t you imprudent? Isn&#39;t it better to leave
your daughter here?&quot; he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Louis did not understand him. &quot;Where I go, she
goes. Besides, they know me very well, these people.
You are not afraid, mister?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afraid! How do we go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steamer to Antivari.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll take you on my yacht.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Louis expressed no surprise. If his guest had
promised a warship with golden plates his sphinx-like
attitude would have been unchanged.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just as you like,&quot; he said. &quot;We take the horses
at Scutari anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To which Faber responded with a further offer.
&quot;I&#39;ve a car on my ship; we&#39;ll put her ashore and try
that road.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Louis shook his head. &quot;No good at all; there isn&#39;t
any damned road. To-day&#39;s Saturday; shall we say
to-morrow morning at ten?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
&quot;But it was to be three days&#39; time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Louis yawned. &quot;Oh, d&mdash;&mdash;n time!&quot; he said. &quot;I
never think of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we&#39;ll start to-morrow at ten.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He drank off his wine and turned to look at
Maryska. She had crept nearer while they talked,
and her head was bent to the floor that she might not
miss a word. When Faber held out his hand to her
she leaned upon her elbows and looked at him with
strange eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye, mister!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are coming on my ship, Maryska.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not with that man,&quot; and she pointed to her father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pouf!&quot; said Louis. &quot;I will flay you with the
whip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I will kill you with my knife,&quot; she said
quickly, in Italian.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the customary exchange of their daily compliments.
Louis rather liked it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say,&quot; he exclaimed on the threshold, &quot;and who
may you be, anyway?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I? Why, my name&#39;s John Faber.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Faber&mdash;Faber? I used to know a Faber in Paris
in the &#39;seventies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His son, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Louis turned his cigarette over in his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you hear of me?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I got your name in Paris. The <i>New York
Mitre</i> people gave it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s odd; I used to know your mother forty
years ago. Well, so long,&quot; and he turned on his heel.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-3" id="ch2-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">THE DAMNABLE MOUNTAINS</p>

<p class="indent">This was a bitter winter on the Albanian frontier,
and God alone knows how the party got to Ranovica
at all.</p>

<p class="indent">None but a madman would have attempted the
journey at such a moment in the story of the Balkans;
but as John Faber remarked, it needed a double-barrelled
charge of insanity to venture it in the winter.
Yet he had told Maryska that he would go, and go
he did.</p>

<p class="indent">What a country, and what a people! The Almighty
seemed to have blasted the mountains and the mountaineers
alike. Such a wilderness of grey rocks, of
weirdly scarped precipices, of awful caverns and fearsome
valleys is to be imagined by none who have not
visited it.</p>

<p class="indent">Depict a range of mountains built up of the barren
limestone into a myriad fearsome shapes of dome and
turret, castle and battlement. In the valleys far below,
put the gardens of the world, fertile beyond all
dreams; where the grapes grow as long as the fingers
on your hand, and every tropical plant luxuriates.
Drive humanity from this scene and deliver it up to
the world and the bear. Such is the frontier of Albania
where it debouches upon Montenegro&mdash;such are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
the &quot;damnable mountains,&quot; as every Christian in their
vicinity has learned to call them.</p>

<p class="indent">A desert upon an altitude, and yet it is not wholly
a desert. Here and there ensconced in nook and
cranny you will come upon an oasis where a village
harbours wild people and a scanty patch of fertile soil
keeps body and soul together. Such a place was
Ranovica, to which Louis de Paleologue led his guest
on the sixth day afterwards. They came up to it at
three o&#39;clock upon that December afternoon when the
sun was magnificent over the Western Adriatic, and
even these desolate hills had been fired to warmth and
colour.</p>

<p class="indent">An odd party&mdash;three upon cheeky little Hungarian
horses; three upon mules. Frank, the American valet,
had much to say about the habits and character of
the mule, but he reserved it until they should be safely
upon the yacht again. The other two servants were
Austrians who had been heavily bribed for the venture&mdash;even
they would have refused had they understood
that it was for an expedition to Ranovica. This
hole in the hill was full of savage Christians who
hated the Montenegrins much, but the Moslem a good
deal more. It was bound to be burned sooner or later.</p>

<p class="indent">Ranovica has a fine old gate built by Stephen of
Bosnia, heaven knows how many years ago. The
party rode through this just after three o&#39;clock, and
was challenged immediately by half-a-dozen warriors
with the most wonderful white breeches the Western
world has seen. Already, and when far down the
valley, the outposts of the little force defending this
wild place had put the travellers through a searching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
inquisition; but they had to face another ordeal at
the gate, and lucky for them that Louis spoke Servian
so fluently. The soldiers listened to him as though a
brother was speaking. They looked at Maryska with
wide black eyes. Why not?&mdash;she was good to look
upon, surely, with her high boots and crimson breeches
and little Greek cap. Faber himself had looked at her
a great many times on the way up, but he was by no
means pleased that she should become the cynosure
of so many evil eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; he said to her, while Louis played the
millionaire among the wild men, &quot;and what do you
think of this, young lady?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was still upon her pretty little horse and her
eyes were here, there and everywhere; but not with
the curiosity an untravelled woman would have displayed.
Maryska had seen too much of the world to
be troubled by Ranovica. Besides, she was hungry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think my father is a fool to come here, and you
also, boss, that is what I think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guess you&#39;ve hit it first time. Are you hungry,
Maryska?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, yes. Are you, boss?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She imitated her father perfectly, and Faber
laughed. They were in a street so narrow that his
horse had a head in the window upon one side of the
road and a tail in a window upon the other. A tremendous
battlement of rock lifted a sheer precipice
far up above this peopled gorge. In the shadows there
moved a fierce people, savage, wild, hunted. They
gathered round the strangers menacingly, and but for
the old white-haired priest, even Louis&#39; gift of tongues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
might not have saved them. The priest, however, liked
the jingle of good Austrian crowns. Let the strangers
come to his house, he said, the inn was not fit to
harbour a dog.</p>

<p class="indent">So the party rode on a furlong&mdash;the men, the girl,
the American valet and the Austrians. At every step
the crowd pressed about them, black and scowling.
It was good at last to enter an open courtyard and to
see that none followed. Dark was coming down then
and lights shining from the windows of the miserable
houses. Faber remembered that he had communicated
with the Turkish authorities before setting out and
congratulated himself upon his prudence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;ll want my guns, and so they&#39;ll want me,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">But he was still mightily anxious about Maryska.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">The priest&#39;s house was about as big as a cow-house
and as filthy as a Spanish podesta. Of food there
was little save coarse bread and villainous-looking
brandy. Here the guests came to the rescue, for Louis
had carried up victuals at Faber&#39;s expense, and now
the good things were spread upon old &quot;Pop&#39;s&quot; table,
to that worthy&#39;s exceeding satisfaction. None ate
with better appetite than he; none smacked fine lips so
loudly over the good white wine, unless it were
Maryska.</p>

<p class="indent">Louis had christened him &quot;Old Pop&quot; immediately,
and he talked to him in voluble Servian during the
repast. Occasionally he interpreted at Maryska&#39;s request,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
and fragments of talk were tossed down to her
as bones to a dog. They made the girl laugh, but
Faber found them grim enough. He was asking
&quot;What does he say?&quot; almost at every sentence. Louis
picked out the tit-bits and passed them on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There were Turks nine miles from here the day
before yesterday. They burned Nitzke, and killed the
women; some of the Nitzke people are here now; one
has lost his nose&mdash;yes, they always cut off the noses,
and so do our fellows when they catch a Turk. This
place would be easy to hold if there were troops, but,
of course, Nicholas can&#39;t send any until war is declared.
Pop hopes that Alussein Pasha won&#39;t find us.
If he does, there&#39;ll be a massacre; yes, it will be in the
next two or three days. You&#39;re not behind the times,
sir; you&#39;ll see the fun if there is any.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber looked at Maryska, and discovered that she
was looking at him. Evidently she shared her father&#39;s
whim of exaggeration and her curiosity as to &quot;the
stranger&#39;s&quot; behaviour was now awake. These odd
terms: &quot;boss,&quot; &quot;stranger,&quot; &quot;master,&quot; picked up from
the backwoods of America twenty years ago, pleased
the Southern ear, and were guarded tenaciously.
Maryska wished to frighten this American, and would
have been delighted had she succeeded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall you do if they come?&quot; she asked him.</p>

<p class="indent">He said, as quickly: &quot;I should go to bed,&quot; and at
that she laughed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what will you do?&quot; he asked her. She leered
as she put a whole sardine into her capacious mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall see them fight. Men are for fighting&mdash;women
to see them. In your country, you have no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
soldiers. All the Americans talk a heap about it, but
none of them have seen anything at all. You will be
a great good man after this, boss!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He opened his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why a great good man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you will have seen something that is great
and good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was very much astonished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean that killing other men is great and
good, Maryska?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her face wore a pensive attitude, but she still had
one eye upon the comestibles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think they are a brave people. I think it is great
and good to fight for your country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, wouldn&#39;t the Americans fight for theirs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps; I don&#39;t know. You are all too clever to
think about anything but money. He says so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t money a very good thing to think about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him with great contempt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was not born a shopkeeper,&quot; she said, and then,
&quot;Ask poppa and hear what he will say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why has poppa come to Ranovica?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To draw pictures for the papers, yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it for money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he will receive it, yes; if he does not like the
people he will not receive it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then how will you live, Maryska?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She tossed her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall live very well, sir; my father is a noble
in his own country. He will not be insulted by such
people; he is very proud.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
And then she said with a ridiculous want of gravity,
&quot;And so am I. Please to give me some of the chocolates,
sir. The old Pop will eat them all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He passed her the chocolates and helped himself
to a cigar from one of his own boxes. The room was
long and narrow, the walls wainscoted in oak and
painted a dirty pink above. An ikon hung in a corner,
for &quot;Pop&quot; was of the Greek Orthodox Church, and
very devout&mdash;when he was not drunk. The latter
appeared now to be his condition, and when they rose
from the table, he insisted upon taking them out into
the village that they might hear him harangue the
people. Night had come down at this time, but no one
thought of sleep in that oasis of the bleak mountains.
Far up on the desolate hills were the sentries who
would tell Ranovica of the Turks&#39; approach. In the
street itself moved a heterogeneous company of old
and young men, and women and laughing girls, everyone
carrying a revolver in the girdle and some armed
to the very teeth. A babble of excited talk fell upon
the night air as a hum of insects. What was in store
for the people of this new citadel? Would the
Turk come or pass them by? God and the morrow
must answer.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">It was a far cry to the great arsenals at Charleston,
but Faber&#39;s mind crossed the seas when he walked
alone that night in the street before the priest&#39;s house.
What particular freak of a latent insanity had sent
him to this place?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
Was it curiosity or the girl? Just the passing fancy
for the wildest little woman he had ever met or the
desire to see his fellow men butchered? One or the
other it must be, and he was too honest to deny it.
Either Maryska or the Turkish butcher, scimitar in
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">If it were the girl, his vain folly had met with a
swift rebuke. Looking up to her bedroom window,
he remembered her &quot;good-night,&quot; and the manner of
it. She had told him that he was an &quot;old, old man,&quot;
and the words struck him as a thunderclap. An &quot;old,
old man!&quot; Good God! had so much of his life already
run? No one had ever spoken such words before and
his vanity bristled. Had the girl been serious, or did
she speak in jest?</p>

<p class="indent">An &quot;old, old man&quot;&mdash;and he was not forty. In
America, it is true, they have little use for forty unless
forty can command allegiance. He, John Faber, had
ruled a city in Charleston. His works employed more
than five thousand men; he was the high priest of
the temples of labour his own brain had built up. No
one remembered his age there. They spoke of him
as &quot;the new Krupp,&quot; the young genius in steel who
could make or mar the fortunes of empires. The
women pursued him relentlessly, remembering his
eleven millions. He could have led the life of an
Oriental debauchee and no one criticise him. To read
the papers&mdash;many of which he owned&mdash;you might
have set him down for twenty-five. This chit of a
wild girl had burst the bubble with a little pin prick of
her candour. An old, old man! The words raked his
self-assurance, he could have boxed her ears for them.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
If not Maryska, what, then, had brought him to
Ranovica?</p>

<p class="indent">Was it to see if he could witness something of that
wild life of the Balkans which had stirred his imagination
in the past? When quite a lad he had read of
these villages and of what befell them when the Turk
came in. One incident he had never forgotten; it
was on the Macedonian frontier where a little town
had been sacked, the men butchered or burned by
naphtha, the women violated, the old priest flayed
alive. He had the account of it in the <i>Illustrated
London News</i> among his papers to that very day.
Such a village as this might have been the scene of it!</p>

<p class="indent">He passed on, musing deeply, and presently met
an Albanian posted at the head of the street. The
soldier had an American rifle, and he discovered that
it had come from his own factory at Charleston. He
gave the man a couple of crowns, and the fellow
grinned savagely, pointing at the same time up to the
silent hills. There were Turks somewhere up there,
and he would shoot them. The rifle was about to do
that for which it was made. Faber would see the
fruit of his own work.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked on a little way and met his valet, Frank.
The young man spoke German fluently, and had
learned a good deal from the Austrian porters. He
was much alarmed by his situation, and did not hesitate
to say so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They tell me an attack is expected, sir. We shall
fare badly in this hole if it comes off. I don&#39;t think
the authorities can do much for us; what&#39;s more, there
ain&#39;t any.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
Faber thrust his hands into his pockets&mdash;a habit
of his&mdash;and walked a little way by his servant&#39;s side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; he said half reflectively, &quot;it isn&#39;t exactly the
Ritz Hotel to be sure. Who&#39;s been talking, Frank?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All of them, sir, all together. Turks are known
to be five miles away and the young lieutenant expects
them to ride in before morning. He says passports
are a sure road to paradise&mdash;you can get to heaven
quicker on an ambassador&#39;s signature than on any
other. I&#39;d do this block next time if I was you, Mr.
Faber, to be sure I would. We may all have our
throats cut before morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber chewed his cigar heavily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Paleologue doesn&#39;t think it; he&#39;s been among
them before. He says the Turks like newspaper men;
he&#39;s one of them. I advised our people in Constantinople
I was coming, and I don&#39;t suppose they&#39;ve gone
to sleep. Anyway, can you fire a gun, Frank?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Frank turned a little pale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d sooner see others fire it, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True enough, and guns won&#39;t be much good if the
knives get going. I think we&#39;ll move on to-morrow,
Frank; we&#39;ll learn what happens from the newspapers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you&#39;d go to-night, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s the young lady to be thought of. I guess
she&#39;s asleep. It&#39;s got to be the morning, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At any particular hour, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As early as you like, Frank, if mademoiselle is
ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young man went off more afraid than he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
say, but glad of the crumb of comfort. His master,
however, continued to walk up and down the narrow
street before the house and to regard the cold mountains
wistfully. What an odd scene! What a place
for him to be in! The hole was full of the queerest
people he had met in all his travels. Every hour added
to the multitude of souls, while as for the inn or guest-house,
it might have been a barracks. Albanians whose
belts were full of knives and revolvers wrangled with
refugees from the mountains who had fled before the
Turks; there were travellers, police, wild women, soldiers,
all boxed up together like sardines in a tin; and
to add to the uproar a mechanical organ played the
&quot;Merry Widow&quot; waltz without an interval. From
time to time shrieks were to be heard and the sound
of blows. A man would come reeling out into the
street with bloody face or gashed limbs. One of them
fell dead almost at the door of the priest&#39;s house, but
no one took any notice of him. As for Louis de
Paleologue and &quot;old Pop&quot; they were far too busy
getting drunk together to observe such a trifle.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber assured himself that the man was quite dead,
and chancing upon two immense Albanians who were
coming down the narrow street, he told them as much
of the story as gestures would permit. They shrugged
their shoulders and entered the guest-house, whence
two or three tipsy fellows emerged presently to drag
the dead man away as though the body were a sack.
Following them to the lower end of the village, Faber
perceived them disappear upon a narrow path by the
side of the gorge he had climbed that afternoon, and
he had no doubt that they would throw the dead man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
into the ravine, and leave the wolves to perform the
last obsequies. He followed them no further, but
stood a little while breathing the cool air and looking
over toward Scutari. There lay Antivari and his
own yacht. His voyage had been successful enough,
and he had found the Emperor complaisant, but this
estimate of his success was attended by another
thought, and it concerned a woman. Sir Jules Achon
would be at Ragusa by this time. Had Sir Jules seen
the Emperor, and if so, to what end?</p>

<p class="indent">Here was a memory of Gabrielle Silvester speaking
to him, and in some way moving him to an exaltation
of success, not wholly chivalrous.</p>

<p class="indent">Had he not wagered that he would obtain an audience
of the Kaiser, while the ridiculous ambassadors
of a silly sentimentalism were still dreaming of their
projects? And what he had promised, he had performed.
The new Faber rifle would go to Germany&mdash;manufactured
in part by Krupps, in part at Charleston.
Meanwhile, universal peace remained a pretty topic
for public platforms, and for certain distinguished
old gentlemen whose philanthropy all the world admired.
He, John Faber, owed something to it for it
had introduced him to one of the cleverest women he
had met in all his life, and this could be said despite
their dramatic farewell. The latter troubled him, to
be sure, but he did not despair of her when he remembered
that the ugly business in Paris could yet be set
straight. Claudine d&#39;Arny must have a husband
bought for her as other women have jewels or toy
dogs. It should not be beyond his resources to contrive
as much.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
He lighted a new cigar upon this pleasant realisation
of power&mdash;a gratification which his busy life
made rare&mdash;and turning about, he retraced his steps
toward Ranovica. The contrast between the lonely
mountains which guarded the valley and the hive of
armed men within was sharp enough, but it interested
him at the moment less than other omens which a
quick ear detected. The stillness seemed to him almost
unnatural. He could have sworn at one place
that a face peered down at him from a cranny of the
precipice above, and, upon that, there came from afar
the echo of a rifle shot. He was sure of it, faint as
was the report and difficult to locate. A rifle shot over
there beyond the great mountain which protected
Ranovica from the northern winds! Long he listened
for any repetition of the firing, but hearing none, returned
at last to the priest&#39;s house. His nerves were
playing tricks with him, he said. It was time to have
done with it. There was a light in Maryska&#39;s room
and a shadow upon the blind said that she was not yet
in bed. Faber smiled as he looked up and remembered
her words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An old, old man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What had put it into the little cat&#39;s head to call
him that?</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span></p>

<h2><a name="ch2-4" id="ch2-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">THE BURNING OF RANOVICA</p>

<p class="indent">There were two beds in the room, and one was
occupied already by Louis de Paleologue, who lay in
a heavy stupor, but was not properly asleep. Faber
had slept in such rooms before&mdash;in the old wild days
when he had travelled in Western America to sell
revolvers to a Christian people, who were set upon
shooting other Christians. This room impressed
chiefly by its omnipresent suggestions of profound
filthiness. He feared to touch anything in it&mdash;the
chairs, the walls, the very coverlet on the bed. His
own rugs were his armament. He wrapped himself
in them from head to foot, and fell asleep at last, still
wondering in his dreams why, in God&#39;s name, he had
come to Ranovica.</p>

<p class="indent">When he awoke, it was at a touch of the hand of
his valet Frank. He felt heavy and drowsy, and knew
that he had missed a good night&#39;s rest&mdash;indispensable
to men whose brains are dominant. It was already
light, and the curtains were drawn back from the
window. He sat up to listen and became aware of a
strange hubbub in the street without.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, what are you saying, Frank; what&#39;s that
you&#39;re telling me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
The valet was ghastly pale; he walked upon tip-toe
as though afraid of being heard; his voice was
hardly more than the whisper of polite servitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The soldiers are in, sir&mdash;it&#39;s all up with Ranovica.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t say so! When did they come in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Five minutes ago, sir. Don&#39;t you hear that&mdash;my
God, don&#39;t you hear it, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There is no mistaking the cry of a man who is
being butchered by knives, and Faber could not mistake
it then. He sprang out of bed at a bound and
ran to the window. The street below was full of
Turks&mdash;the red fez, the baggy blue breeches were
everywhere. Leaning out to get a better view, he saw
a huge Albanian held down by four assassins who had
the faces of the devils in the pictures. Another, like
to them, had a broad butcher&#39;s knife in his hand, and
was deliberately hacking the prone man&#39;s head from
his shoulders. It was clumsily done and the wretch
shrieked horribly at every cut upon the bare flesh.
His blood already ran in the gutters, where it mingled
with the blood of fifty others.</p>

<p class="indent">A sense of utter helplessness&mdash;of a sickness and
horror he had not yet experienced, held Faber to the
window for some minutes. He could look at nothing
else but the outstretched figure and the clumsy knife.
When head and body at length were torn apart, and
the former held up on the end of a scimitar, a loud
shout of fury escaped him, and he ran across the room
for his revolver. The uproar had awakened Paleologue,
who sat bolt upright watching his friend. When
he perceived the revolver in his hand, he sprang out
of bed and caught him in powerful arms.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
&quot;What are you doing, boss&mdash;what d&mdash;&mdash;d nonsense
is this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell you they&#39;re hacking men to pieces in the street
out yonder. Let me go&mdash;by God, I can&#39;t stand it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, don&#39;t be a fool. Do you think you can shoot
a regiment? Keep that pistol out of sight, and hold
your tongue. We&#39;ll have them up here if you butt in
like that! Don&#39;t you understand it isn&#39;t our business?
Why, you&#39;re more d&mdash;&mdash;d nuisance than any woman&mdash;and
you talk as much. Now, be quiet, and hear me
out. You&#39;ve got to sit this through and say nothing.
I&#39;ll do the talking for myself and the girl. You look
on and remember why you&#39;re here. Haven&#39;t you
sense enough at your age?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The irony of it stung Faber, and he put the pistol
down. The frightened valet still looked out of the
window and howled at intervals, as though he himself
were already in the hands of the Turks. They could
hear rifle shots, sometimes a volley, then a few straggling
reports, which spoke of fugitives, who were making
a dash for the mountains. In the street itself, it
seemed that men scurried hither and thither as rats
from their holes. Shouts of triumph were followed by
sharp cries of pain, often by groans and the shrill
screams of women. The air came pungent with the
odour of gunpowder. In the room itself there was
now silence save for the servant&#39;s bellowing. Paleologue
dressed himself without any fuss whatever, and
he did not utter a single word. When he was quite
ready, he went out into the street immediately&mdash;Faber
at his heels. No one had asked for Maryska.</p>

<p class="indent">Paleologue was wearing a ridiculous suit of yellow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
tweed at this time, and a green Homburg hat with a
feather in it. He carried no other weapons than a
cigarette case and a box of matches. The Turks
round about eyed him with amazement not untempered
by curiosity; but before any of them could make a
movement he shouted out in their own tongue that he
was an English newspaper correspondent, and their
rifles were lowered. Doffing his cap to a man upon a
little grey horse, who appeared to be their officer, the
artist crossed the street and offered him a cigarette,
speaking rapidly in the careless way he could command,
whatever the language. Faber listened open
mouthed. He thought that he was as near to death
as ever he had been in his nine and thirty years, and
he made no poor guess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does he say, Frank?&quot; the question was
hurled up at the window where the valet&#39;s white face
could be seen. He might as well have asked the fellow
a question in Chinese.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know, sir. I think he is mad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess we were all mad to come here. My God!
what a slaughter-house!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No truer description of the scene could have been
uttered by any man. The streets of Ravonica had
become a shambles. Turks ran in and out of the
distant houses like dogs at a warren. There were
twenty headless bodies within ten yards of the captain
in command. From the door of the inn or guest-house
a broad eddy of blood was oozing away to the
gutter; they could hear the troops within looting and
ravaging at their pleasure, while the wretched organ
still played some trumpery waltz in irony most wonderful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
So dreadful it was that Faber, who believed
that he knew the whole story of war, staggered back
in a revolt of nausea and would have re-entered the
priest&#39;s house but for Paleologue&#39;s imperative summons.
The artist had never been more at home. He
wore his hat jauntily and smoked with gusto while
he talked to the captain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, boss, come and report yourself. This is
Alussein Pasha. He has had word of you from
headquarters; just shake and look as pleased as you
can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber shook hands with the man, while Louis
offered him a cigarette and struck matches for them
all. The concomitants of the ghastly scene were
wholly out of place and singularly at variance with
the truth. These three men might have met by accident
in this outlandish village and have been discussing
the best road back to civilization. The bloody struggle,
still proceeding in the miserable hovels round about,
moved Alussein Pasha no more than did the howling
of dogs in an Eastern street. And Paleologue was
just as indifferent until some of the ruffians fetched
out &quot;old Pop&quot; by the hair of his head and held a
scimitar at his throat. Then, to be fair to him, he
woke up to the truth and began to argue excitedly
with the Pasha&mdash;at which moment also Maryska appeared
at a window above and spoke to her father in
Italian. He answered with a wave of his hand, bidding
her disappear; but not before a Turkish subaltern
had seen her and thrown her a kiss in the Western
fashion. This was too much for Louis, who knocked
him down out of hand.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
Undoubtedly it was a mad act, and went near to
costing the lives of the party. Alussein Pasha uttered
a roar like a stricken bull when his officer was floored;
the Turks about him drew their knives and pressed
upon Faber with fierce shouts. He had as good as
given it up, and thought that this was the end of the
business, when a young man at the Pasha&#39;s side said
something to his chief in an earnest note and appeared
to bring that savage worthy to his senses. He roared
an order to the hawking pack, and they fell back from
the prey they had marked down. An excited exchange
of doubtful compliments between Louis and the grand
Turk was followed by a compromise, Alussein stipulating
for an immediate return to the shelter of the
priest&#39;s house until the affair was over. So, in they
went, the soldiers half pushing them with the butts of
their rifles and barring the door behind them. &quot;Old
Pop&quot; was the only prisoner now. They had forgotten
him in the excitement of that very critical moment
through which they had passed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have a drink?&quot; said Louis, throwing himself into
a chair by the window and his hat into another; he
seemed quite unconcerned, even unaware that there
had been an instant of peril. John Faber, on the
other hand, was talking to himself in decided terms.
&quot;John, my boy, you&#39;re a d&mdash;&mdash;d fool to be here,&quot; he
was saying&mdash;and that was very true. When he had
drunk a tumbler of white wine and mineral water he
found the sweat running off him like rain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hot weather for the time of year. Where&#39;s your
girl, Louis?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! I guess she&#39;s all right&mdash;better where she is.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
Will you pass over that drawing pad? I can see a
picture here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber passed him the pad, and he settled deep in
the arm-chair and began to make a rapid sketch of
the crowded street. At the same moment Maryska
entered the room and closed the door firmly behind
her.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is the priest?&quot; she asked them in a strange
tone. The men looked at her together, then at each
other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, isn&#39;t he in the house?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are killing him,&quot; she said. And then,
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Louis put down his pencil, and leaning out of the
window, which was on a level with the street, he
watched the scene a little while in silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By God!&quot; he cried at last; &quot;they&#39;re singeing the
old man&#39;s beard. Listen to that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They listened and heard a harrowing sound, neither
cry nor scream, but the wail as of a cat mewing.
Twenty Turks had &quot;Old Pop&quot; in their midst; they
had torn his clothes from his back and cut off his
nose. Now some of them brought naphtha and poured
it on his head, and instantly he became a vomit of
flame.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Every feature of the wretched man could be
seen with horrid distinctness, clarified by the fire.
The flesh withered up before their eyes. He stood
for a long minute plucking at his own flesh with hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
of which but the bones were left. Then, all his cries
ceased, and he fell forward in a ghastly heap, while
the Turks howled derisively and thrust scimitars into
the fire. They had burned many a priest these latter
days, but this fellow was famous, and had fought
many a good fight for Ranovica. His death stimulated
a frenzy of lust and madness, and they rushed away
to enter the houses and drive out the women. All the
make-believe of a military occupation had been put
aside by this time. Alussein had led them across the
mountains to teach these Christians a lesson, and they
were good masters.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_1_1">
<span class="label">[1]</span></a>
The incident here described is taken almost unchanged from
the recent story of Macedonia.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Maryska heard the priest&#39;s cries, but she did not
see the manner of his death. Had it not happened so
swiftly and with such dramatic finality, the men would
have made some stir to save him; but, as though guessing
their intention, a group of soldiers with rifles
across their arms pressed about the window, and made
it very clear that they would shoot upon next to no
provocation at all. Alussein Pasha had ridden on at
this time to the lower road overlooking Scutari, and
would return when the good work was done. He
would declare that the villagers had brought it all on
themselves, and his report would be a model of tearful
orthodoxy. Meanwhile, there were very few of the
male inhabitants to bring anything upon anybody; the
women alone remained, and they were dragged from
their houses, some by the hair of their heads, some
forced by thrust of swords, a few going without protest,
as though they dreamed. Of the latter were the
younger girls, mere children of fourteen or fifteen
years, who stood in a little group before the priest&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
house, and looked at the soldiers, uncertain&mdash;nay,
ignorant&mdash;of their meaning. Maryska saw these
anon; and Louis also. He had been chewing his
cigarette very busily since the priest died, and there
were few lines upon the paper. As for Faber, he
merely stood motionless by the window. The scene
held him spellbound with an influence he knew to be
evil.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have they done with the priest? Why do
you not answer me, Mr. Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She touched him upon the arm, and he looked down
upon a child&#39;s face from which a woman&#39;s eyes stared
up at him wonderingly. What answer could he make
to her?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must just run away and think nothing about
it, Maryska,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;We can none of us
do anything. I wish to God we could.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you not going to speak for the children, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The children! Oh, they&#39;re all right; they won&#39;t
hurt the children.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is not true,&quot; she said, for the instinct of the
woman guided her surely. &quot;Someone must speak for
the children. Will not you, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The appeal touched Paleologue, and he threw away
the stump of his cigarette and leaned out of the window.
They heard him talking rapidly with the Turks
upon the side-walk, and presently shouting something
to an officer before the guest-house opposite. Whatever
he said moved the soldiers to derision and the
children themselves to hope. They knew that he was
their friend, and their round eyes watched his every
gesture.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
&quot;What&#39;s the man saying?&quot; Faber asked. Louis
hardly seemed to know.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess it&#39;s a bad business, boss, a d&mdash;&mdash;d bad
business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t mean to say&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do every word of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must see this thing through, Paleologue. I&#39;m
going out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can&#39;t go out. What&#39;s the good of doing
stunts? They&#39;ll shoot, sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He tried to hold back the impetuous man, appealing
and swearing in a breath. From below, the children
watched the scene with a look of bewilderment and
despair. The unknown strangers were quarrelling,
then! What hope of mercy had they if this went
on? This must have been in their minds when
Maryska, climbing nimbly as a cat, slipped by her
father and leaped down among the Turks. She was
kissing and hugging some of the children and telling
them in a tongue they understood that all would be
well with them; doing this, and defying the snarling
troopers before a man could have counted ten. Then
the men at the window lost sight of her, the throng
closing about her as water filling the vortex of a falling
stone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God, man, aren&#39;t you going now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Paleologue licked his lips, a little astonished, perhaps,
not to find a cigarette between them. He caught
up a great planter&#39;s hat and clapped it on the side of
his head; then, without a word, he clambered over the
casement and pushed his way among the soldiers. Of
course, Faber was upon his heels, treading so close on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
his tracks that they stumbled into the press together
and were instantly swallowed up by it. Instructed to
deal patiently with the strangers, none of the sentries
fired upon them, but all swarmed about them and
tried to pull them back. The village itself had by this
time become a Golgotha, from whose wretched houses
came the groans of butchered men and the screams of
women in an agony of fear and shame. Their terrible
cries were echoed up and down the streets from
many a group which stooped about an infamy; while
at the far end near the church, flames spurted from an
isolated house, and the wood burned with a detonation
heard closely upon the still air. The outposts of the
legions of hell had begun their work; they would do
it thoroughly enough before their chief returned to call
them off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where&#39;s my daughter? What have you done with
her?&quot; Paleologue&#39;s voice rose to a shrill pitch as he
pushed and fought his way into the crowd and was
thrust forward and still forward by the wiry American
at his heels. Faber had never imagined such a scene
as this, nor could he have believed it possible. The
heat and clamour of the street, the sweat of the fighting
men; here and there a girl caught in a man&#39;s arms
and held firmly as a wild beast holds its prey; smoke
of the burning house coming down upon the wind&mdash;the
crazy organ still rolling out its dirge-like waltzes.
All this and the fierce oaths of the maladroitly butchered&mdash;the
horrid, gashed corpses in the gutters&mdash;the
rearing, terrified horses of Alussein&#39;s lieutenants; and,
above it all, the serene sky and the desolate mountains
lifting their scarred summits in savage menace. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
an inferno, what a hell of human creation! And into
this the girl Maryska had plunged, headlong as a bold
swimmer into a raging sea which has engulfed a child.</p>

<p class="indent">He found himself imitating Paleologue by and by,
and calling her name aloud. The attempts of the
sentries to get the pair of them back to the house
were met by thrust upon thrust; a good square push
from the shoulder here and a dive into an opening
there. Gradually they won their way up the street,
but could not find her; and upon that a sense of desperation
drove them to some imprudence, and they
began to deal in blows. Such madness might have
brought a swift penalty but for the fire which the
priest&#39;s death had kindled. The God of Ranovica,
designing that these people should perish to bear
witness to their faith, willed also that Ranovica should
fall with them, and that the priest should be the instrument.
From his body the flames had run to the
crazy house; from the house to the church, and thence
to the narrow street, which instantly became aglow.
Faber found himself pressing forward amid showers
of sparks, and still crying &quot;Maryska&mdash;Maryska!&quot; as
though the child&#39;s voice could be heard amid the din.
Turks pressed about him shielding their faces with
sun-browned arms and cursing the &quot;spawn of dogs&quot;
by which the visitation had come upon them. He
was driven in and out of courtyards, tossed hither and
thither by the human wave, whose crest was the
whirling scimitars of the destroyers. In the end he
found himself out upon the hillside, flaming Ravonica
below him, and the still air alive with the cries of its
people. Paleologue had disappeared; there was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
trace of Maryska, and he himself had hardly a rag
upon his back.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat down upon a great boulder, and presently
heard a familiar voice. It was that of his valet,
Frank.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Faber, is that you, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess it is, Frank.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank God for that, sir! Our baggage is done
for, sure and certain. The house is afire from top to
bottom, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind the baggage, Frank. Have you seen
Mr. Paleologue?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was down among the soldiers five minutes
ago, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the young lady?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Frank could not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She went away with some of the young women&mdash;I
think toward the church, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was that long ago?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About five minutes before they fired it; I&#39;m sure it
wasn&#39;t more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, look at the church now, anyway. This is
an awful business, Frank.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose in their way it&#39;s what they call war, sir.
But it&#39;s a terrible business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Faber. &quot;I suppose it would be. You
don&#39;t happen to have a cigar on you, Frank?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got a few cigarettes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then pass one up. We&#39;ll go and look for Mr.
Paleologue presently; I guess he&#39;s taken the lower
road. We should find both of them there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope we shall do so, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
He passed the cigarettes and the matches, and his
master lighted one and sat and smoked in silence. It
may be that he asked himself what he, John Faber,
was doing out there upon this bleak hillside when he
might have been on board his yacht in the harbour of
Antivari. Such reflections had occurred to him on
several occasions when some absurd venture had
brought him very near to that haven where millions
are the poorest credentials; but they were unduly
ironical to-day, and not a little persistent. Why had
he come to Ranovica? Because that little wide-eyed
woman, who made such a curious appeal to him, had
insisted upon his coming. It was very true, and he
would not fence with it. He might lose his life for
Maryska even yet; and that would be a grotesque
finale enough. Meanwhile, a certain doubt about her
remained and troubled him with a graver thought.
Why had he not discovered her in the village? No
man could venture into that inferno now, for the whole
place was just a flame upon the hillside; but he had
been up and down the street with Paleologue, and
they had seen nothing of her. He thought it curious
if nothing more. They should have discovered her
immediately when the fire broke out.</p>

<p class="indent">Alussein Pasha rode up presently and his little staff
with him. He had treated Faber with some deference
from the beginning, and now that the fury of the
sack was over he became almost grotesquely polite,
gabbling in appalling German and expressing as well
as he could his regret for the state in which he discovered
the stranger. In return, Faber asked him of
his friend&mdash;gesture serving where names failed&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
the matter being understood, the Pasha told off a
lieutenant and two men who invited the &quot;infidel&quot; to
follow them. Ranovica had burned itself to a cinder
by this time, and if it was not possible to pass down
the narrow street, at least the precincts of the houses
might be searched. Faber trudged after the men and
came to the ruined church, now but a shell and a few
blackened beams. A young Turkish soldier walked
to and fro here; but the gulley of the road before the
church was blocked by corpses, and near by them lay
the figure of Louis de Paleologue. He had been shot
through the head just as he reached the porch, and he
lay face downwards, an unlighted cigarette between
his lips and his kindly eyes wide open.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber knelt and turned the dead man over. He
felt his pulse, and even laid his head upon his chest
to listen for the beating of his heart. There had been
horrors enough in Ranovica this day; but they had
to do with a strange and savage people, of whom he
knew nothing. He remembered that this man had
taken his mother to America when she had no other
friend in the world. Had he not come to Europe to
reward him for what he had done as few have been
rewarded, whatever the service? And this was the
end of it&mdash;this prone figure, still and fearful&mdash;this, and
the Turks who looked down upon the scene with Oriental
indifference&mdash;this, and the sentry who leered
behind their backs and made no attempt to hide his
satisfaction. Faber caught the fellow grinning, and
recognized him for one of the men who had turned
on him earlier in the day when Paleologue floored the
officer. The rifle in his hand had come from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
arsenal at Charleston. Surely destiny spoke loudly
enough here.</p>

<p class="indent">He borrowed a burned and tattered cloak from one
of the dead in the gutter, and covered his friend&#39;s face
reverently. Where to go, what to do next, he knew
not; nor in what manner he should seek Maryska.
The truth had gripped him with fingers of iron.</p>

<p class="indent">This was war&mdash;and of war was he not the disciple?</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">The Turks left the village about three in the after-noon.
It was understood that they had other work of
the kind, but more to the northward, and removed
from the observant eye of their neighbours, the Montenegrins,
who would surely avenge this day. Before
they left, they were able to restore to Faber the mules
which had brought his party to Ranovica. The beasts
had been taken up the hillside during the conflagration,
and would have been led much further afield but for
the Pasha&#39;s desire to curry favour with the American.
He knew that this was the man who made the rifles
with which the infidel dogs must be destroyed; urgent
messages from Constantinople had warned him to
show deference to so useful an ally, and he obeyed his
instructions with a display of manners quite pleasing.
It was otherwise when the dead artist and his daughter
were mentioned. Constantinople had said nothing
about them, and it really seemed to Faber that the
flat-faced, good-humoured Alussein could be a genius
of understanding or the dullest blockhead at his
pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
So away the Turk went, just when the sun was
beginning to dip down over the Adriatic and all the
wilderness to glow beneath the shimmer of its deepening
rays. A hillside, normally grey and cold, shone
rose-pink and purple in the waxing splendour of the
hour. The burned village became but the blacker
for the gift, a charred log lying in a cup of the burnished
rocks. Out of it, when every ruin had been
twice searched, every heap of ashes turned for possible
plunder, out of it went the baggy breeches and the
little white horses and the fierce and bristling men, as
cool and laconic as though this were but an episode
and to-morrow would furnish another. Romancers&#39;
tales of troops drunk with lust and slaughter could not
be told of them. All that passed, women&#39;s fearful
struggles to escape their embraces, the shrieks of men
whose hearts were being torn out, the gasps of the
dying and the livid faces of the dead&mdash;all this was
already forgotten, and would hardly be remembered
when a week had gone. Had not the Prophet commanded
them so to do, and was not he a discerning
person withal?</p>

<p class="indent">Faber had taken a meal with Alussein upon the hillside
about midday, and after that he had patrolled the
village with Frank at his side, waiting and hoping for
the coming of Maryska. To return to Ragusa without
her would have been an infamy he could not contemplate;
and yet he feared to meet her or to tell her
the truth which must be told. When at last he did
discover her, some hours had passed, and it was quite
dark. The hillside with its savage boulders had given
up the most part of the refugees then, and they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
come down to the village to wander amid the ruins
of their poor homes and to fill the street with their
wailing. It was at this time also that another band
of Albanians came up the valley to their comrades&#39;
rescue; alas, so many hours too late, but yet in time
to help the desperate refugees and to bring them food
and succour. Fires were now lighted by the valley
road, and the women and children grouped about them.
The most timid crept down from the rocks above;
girls dishevelled and weeping, men who had fled with
gashed limbs to the harbourage of caves, children
whose parents lay dead beneath the ashes&mdash;all came
at the summons of the shrill goat&#39;s horn. Meanwhile,
none thought of burying the dead&mdash;none except Faber,
who would not leave the body of Louis de Paleologue
where it was, and returned with two lusty Albanians
at his heels to do what could be done in the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">It was then that he found Maryska.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the Albanians carried a lantern, and the rays
of it discovered her, kneeling against the broken railings
of the church porch, but with face averted from
the dead. She did not appear to have been weeping.
Her eyes were big and round; her head bare, her hair
dishevelled. What she had suffered at the soldiers&#39;
hands might not be imagined; but its memories had
been obliterated by this sudden realization of the
greater loss. All that humanity had been to her lay
still and ghastly in that fearsome gutter. Father,
brother, friend&mdash;he who had gone hand in hand with
her through the wild wilderness of the world, he would
lead her no more. The night had dropped a black
curtain between her and the eternal hope of youth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
Womanhood had revealed itself, its secrets thrust upon
her by the bloody hands of monsters; but the drugged
soul of the child could find no place in her mind for
that. He was dead. Why, then, did she live?</p>

<p class="indent">She shrank from the light, but did not cover her
eyes. Discerning Faber, she leaped toward him as an
animal unchained, and bared her breast with frenzied
fingers. &quot;Shoot me, stranger&mdash;shoot me through the
heart!&quot; she cried. He caught her outstretched hand,
and she fell almost lifeless into his arms. Oblivion, the
greater mercy, saved her reason in the critical hour.
She was in a delirium when they made a rude palanquin
and carried her down to Antivari. She awoke
therefrom upon the afternoon of the second day after
in a cabin upon Faber&#39;s yacht; and then, for the first
time, they believed that she would live.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-5" id="ch2-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">A STRANGE VOYAGE</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Wanderer</i>, carrying Sir Jules Achon and his
party, lay in Ragusa harbour when the fugitives came
down from the hills. The two boats were moored almost
side by side in the offing, and hardly had Faber
set foot aboard when he sent a message to Gabrielle,
begging her help in an emergency. Half an hour later
she met him at the head of the gangway ladder, and
he led her at once into the gorgeous saloon of the
<i>Savannah</i>, as his own boat was named.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this the emergency?&quot; she asked laughingly, as
she pointed to the wonderful decoration of the cabin.
He told her as bluntly that it was not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got a patient on board,&quot; he said. &quot;Will you
help me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know that I will&mdash;very gladly. Is he here
now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not he&mdash;it&#39;s she. That&#39;s why I sent for one
of her own sex. God help a foreign woman in this
part of the world! This is a mere baby. She calls me
an &#39;old, old man.&#39; So I guess she&#39;s interesting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He betrayed no emotion of any kind. His anxiety
concerning the child, his perception of the irony of fate
directing his footsteps into such strange paths, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
baser curiosity which had sent him into the hills, were
masked successfully by that clear-cut face. Gabrielle
imagined that his act was an impulse of charity, and
she was pleased that he had made her the instrument
of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is this precious derelict, and what has happened
to her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s in the pink saloon. Don&#39;t speak of it lightly.
She&#39;s lost her father, and has not a friend in the
world. I knew she would find her way to your heart.
Shall we go and see her? The doctor&#39;s there now, I
guess. We&#39;ll have to get our orders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He led the way to the cabin, and they went in. It
was a beautiful room, and his servants already had
smothered it in flowers. A young Austrian doctor
from Ragusa was trying to give the head stewardess
his instructions, and failing as dismally. He turned
with relief to Gabrielle, whose German was pretty if
not eloquent. The cabin was to be kept as quiet as
possible; the patient must be watched zealously in
case of sudden collapse. He understood that this was
a case of shock, and could know nothing until consciousness
returned. His suggestion that a nurse should be
fetched from one of the military hospitals was refused
almost ungraciously by the English girl he so plainly
admired. Gabrielle would play the part herself. She
had already removed her furs, and was busy about
the cabin where artistic fingers could do so much. It
was quite needless for the doctor to repeat his instructions
as he was prepared to; she dismissed both him
and her host with a wave of the hand which said &quot;begone&quot;
as no tongue could have uttered the word.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
It was nine o&#39;clock at night before Faber saw her
again. His dinghy had gone across to the <i>Wanderer</i>
with a message explaining the circumstances, but he
himself remained on deck, waiting for news that might
be a new echo of this pitiful tragedy. But a few days
ago he had entered that beautiful place and discovered
the little nomad whose life now hung upon a thread.
He had wished to bring happiness to her father and
herself, but had failed beyond repair. Money did not
help him in the wilds of Albania, nor could money buy
one jot or tittle of content for the child of the man he
had discovered in the cavern. Had not he himself
paid for the journey to Ranovica&mdash;a whim which cost
the life of a man to whom he owed his very existence?
And now the child was his legacy. He stood at the
taffrail wondering what unnameable secret she had
carried down from the hills.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps he remembered the multitude of women
who had so suffered since God Almighty created a
battlefield; but understanding had never come in that
way hitherto. Little Maryska&mdash;he would have given
a good deal of his lavish fortune to have saved her
life that night. His heart bounded when Gabrielle
came out of the cabin at last to bring him better news
of the invalid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is conscious and would see you. I think you
had better go down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you approve my going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him in a curious way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has asked for you, Mr. Faber.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, then, I&#39;ll go right now. Have you eaten
that dinner yet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
&quot;As much as I want. I must go now and get my
things from the yacht.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you&#39;ll come back, sure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I must&mdash;there&#39;s no one else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s right down fine of you. I knew you&#39;d do
it when you understood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked him full in the face and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are some things no woman can misunderstand.
I shall not be very long. Please let her talk
as little as possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; he said, fallen to a grave manner. &quot;I fear
this is a bad business altogether.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not ask him why, nor had she any clue to
his meaning. The whole affair was a mystery which
could have but a human solution. She made light
of the romantic story concerning Louis de Paleologue,
and believed, with a feminine instinct for the obvious,
that vulgar flirtation had been the impulse of Faber&#39;s
journey. All this hurt her pride, but could not be
the just subject of complaint. Tenaciously she clung
to the idea that she might yet use this master intellect
for the schemes which had lifted her father and herself
from the slough of monotony to a little place in
the story of the world. This very accident, this revelation
of a man&#39;s weakness, might be a precious opportunity,
however deeply her vanity suffered. If she
succeeded, her triumph must be the greater; if she
failed&mdash;&mdash;But failure was a word which Gabrielle
Silvester refused to add to her vocabulary.</p>

<p class="indent">So she went over to the <i>Wanderer</i> to tell her father
of the sick girl, and to add, almost in a whisper, &quot;I
believe there&#39;s a good deal in it.&quot; To which Silvester
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
replied that he was sorry to hear it, &quot;for,&quot; said he,
&quot;there is no man alive who could do so great a work
if he would come over to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">Faber went straight down to Maryska&#39;s cabin and
found her crouching upon a pillow. The long, jet
black hair had been taken down, and lay in a tangled
skein about her; she was very pale, and her eyes
glowed as with a fever. Evidently she had been listening
for his footsteps, for she turned instantly when
he came in and fixed her eyes upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s Mr. Faber,&quot; she said, but without satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">He took a chair and drew it to her bedside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Maryska, are you feeling better, my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She paid not the slightest heed to the question.
Sitting up in bed, she closed her gown about her chest
and breathed a little heavily. Then she said, without
warning:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is my father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He bent his head, fearing to meet her gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear little girl, you&#39;ll remember all about that
presently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long pause upon this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said at last, and still apparently unmoved;
&quot;I do remember. Why did you let him die,
Mr. Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I, Maryska? I had nothing to do with it. If
he had taken my advice he would not have left the
Pasha&#39;s side. I was quite a long way off when it
happened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
She insisted, looking at him with pathetic eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you had not come to Ragusa, he would not
have left me. I am sorry you came. Shall I be kept
here long?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean in this ship?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course. Is it your ship, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s my ship&mdash;at least, I&#39;ve hired it. Don&#39;t you
like it, my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked round about her critically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not very rich,&quot; she said at last. &quot;We
came from America in a much larger ship than this.
He was with me then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes filled suddenly with tears, and she saw
no longer either the cabin or the man. Faber covered
the outstretched hand, and stroked it softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My poor little girl! You must make your home
with me now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not rich; it would be different with you,&quot;
she said; and then, in just the childish tone she had
used at the Cantina, she exclaimed, &quot;I don&#39;t believe
you have much money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed, and reassured her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve a great deal more than you or I will ever
want, Maryska.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was evident that the wolf-child was suspicious.
The gipsy instincts were awake.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you give me some money if I want any?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll give you as much as you ask me for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Five crowns, say&mdash;would you give me five
crowns?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I would.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
&quot;Here and now?&quot; and she held out her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">He was nonplussed for the moment, but he took a
bank-note from his pocket, and thrust it into her tiny
fist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, I guess there are fifty crowns and more
there, Maryska. You shall have another when you
want it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The hand closed upon the bank-note like a vise.
None the less, her thoughts were not wholly of the
money.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If my father had been here he would have been
very glad of this. He will never know now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe that. He&#39;ll know that you&#39;ve become
my little daughter, Maryska. He&#39;ll understand
that all right. My home&#39;s yours now. I want you
to understand that right here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head, the long hair smoothed back
from her forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will never know. I cannot speak to him. I
have tried so hard and he does not hear me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Believe no such thing, my dear. He hears every
word you say. He knows that you will be happy
with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With you, Mr. Faber? Why should I stay with
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I mean to make a home for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you make it upon this ship?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, you couldn&#39;t live always upon a ship.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She became practical.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would sooner live in Ragusa; but not in the
Cantina, because he would not be there with us. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
is very cheap, and if you had the money we could live
very well upon a crown a day and the wine. I have
had no wine since I came away; the lady would not
give me any. If you have any money left and would
send for some wine&mdash;&mdash;&quot; She looked up beseechingly,
with a look which reminded him of the little wild wolf
who had run to the wine-shop the night he discovered
her father. He hardly knew how to satisfy her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll send down anything the doctor orders for you.
If he says wine&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried, flown into a passion in an instant.
&quot;I could kill you&mdash;I could kill you for that!&quot; And
without another word she turned her face to the wall
and still clutching her money tenaciously, she made
it plain that she had done with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, Maryska,&quot; he said, rising, &quot;you shall
have the wine all right. I don&#39;t care that for the
doctors; I&#39;ll see to it myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not answer him, and lay so still that she
might have been dead.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle returned immediately after the interview
was terminated, and with her Harry Lassett, who by
no means liked the circumstances of her visit, and had
come to verify them. She went at once to Maryska&#39;s
cabin, but Lassett remained on deck to sample the
green cigars, and incidentally to cross-question their
owner. He talked upon a number of subjects with the
assurance of twenty-three years and the experience of
ten.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
&quot;I&#39;ve heard a lot of things about you from Gabrielle.
Of course, you know I&#39;m engaged to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber finished the operation of striking a match
and then lighted his cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, is that so? My congratulations. When is
it to be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I dunno; marriage is a considerable proposition.
Besides, I&#39;m going out to Australia next winter&mdash;cricket,
you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! you play ball, then? Is there much to it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Harry grinned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing. I&#39;m an amateur, you know&mdash;that is,
if you know anything about the game at all. We can&#39;t
take any money for our services, so we have to charge
expenses. And jolly well we&#39;re worth it&mdash;some of us,&quot;
he added with conviction.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber nodded, as though he understood perfectly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you deliver the goods. There&#39;s something
of that sort in my country, only we don&#39;t call &#39;em
amateurs. Anyway, the name doesn&#39;t hurt. You&#39;ll
be married when you come back, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! there you <i>cherchez la femme</i>. Gabrielle isn&#39;t
struck with marriage&mdash;not very much. She&#39;s full of
this tomfool business about peace on earth and goodwill
toward Wilhelm. It makes me sick to listen to it.
The yacht loaded up with cranks, and every one of
them trying to get something out of Sir Jules. It&#39;s
almost as good a game as Throgmorton Street, if you
can find the mugs, chiefly those with handles. I tell
you, I&#39;m just fed up with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t get thin on it, sure. How long does
Sir Jules propose to stop here? Has he said that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
&quot;He&#39;ll stop on the off chance of another interview
with the Emperor on his return from Corfu.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The first one wasn&#39;t satisfactory, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, lots of pats on the back and that sort of thing&mdash;plenty
of butter, but not much bread. By the way,
do you think there&#39;s anything in the business, or is
it just fancy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think there&#39;s a great deal. Sir Jules Achon is
about the deepest thinker in this line I&#39;ve yet struck.
But he wants a man with him&mdash;he wants a hustler.
Europe listens when you beat the drum, but it&#39;s got
to be a mighty big drum nowadays. He&#39;s merely playing
with fiddle-sticks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s because his drummer is on the sick list.
I hear he&#39;s a regular roarer&mdash;Rupert Trevelle, who
hustled Balfour into the Blue Ensign Club. He was
to have been here, but he&#39;s down with neuritis or
something. They say that&#39;s why we&#39;re all drifting
about the Adriatic doing nothing but patting each
other&#39;s back. It will be different when Trevelle gets
going.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then set him going right quick. Does Miss Silvester
take to it kindly? Is she dead earnest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s just what I want to know. I&#39;ll tell you
what, though&mdash;she won&#39;t be when she&#39;s married to me.
No peace at any price in my house, I&#39;m d&mdash;&mdash;d if
there is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t believe in it, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does any good Britisher really believe in it? Wars
made us what we are. Would Nelson have gone to a law
court? And what price would Drake receive in a county
court action for singeing the Spanish King&#39;s beard? I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
tell you it&#39;s all d&mdash;&mdash;d nonsense, and some of &#39;em must
know it to be so. When I am married to Gabrielle&mdash;&mdash;But
here she comes, my boy, so mum&#39;s the word.
There&#39;s time enough for arguments&mdash;eh, what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber smiled and stood up to get another chair.
Gabrielle was very serious, and looked gracious in her
perplexity. She had a strange tale to tell of her
patient, and recited it in a kind of astonished despair
which amused her host very much.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;the child drinks
wine like an alderman. Whatever am I to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot; cried Harry. &quot;You&#39;re rotting, Gabrielle,
you&#39;re not serious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s true, every word of it. She says that she is
doing it by your orders, Mr. Faber. Is it really so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much has she taken? I sent a bottle down.
It&#39;s only the light stuff they drink hereabouts. You
can hardly call it wine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has drunk the whole bottle. I was never
more astonished in my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall have to humour her a bit. Of course,
it must be stopped. And that reminds me&mdash;I want a
home for her in England. Will you and your father
give her one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;ll do for the &#39;horrid&#39; example at your temperance
meetings, Gabrielle. Better take her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think,&quot; said Gabrielle, &quot;you had better see my
father. You know that he is undecided about this call
to Yonkers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He won&#39;t be undecided about it when I&#39;ve had
my say. Is the patient all right now? Do you think
well of her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
&quot;I think she is terribly distressed, and is hiding it
from all of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A brave little girl! I guessed as much. We must
get her away from this place as soon as possible.
When does Sir Jules propose to sail?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not until the Emperor leaves Corfu. He said so
at lunch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;ll weigh before then; the Emperor doesn&#39;t
mean to see him a second time. Anyway, you won&#39;t
leave her, Miss Silvester, I go pat on that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She averted her eyes from both of them, and looked
away to the other yacht.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think I ought to leave her. The better
way will be for you to see my father. She&#39;s sleeping
now. We might go over to the <i>Wanderer</i> at once, if
you liked&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And make it an excuse for a jolly little supper on
deck,&quot; said Harry voraciously. He had done little but
eat and sleep since they left London.</p>

<p class="center">IV</p>

<p class="indent">Gordon Silvester was as astonished as Gabrielle by
the proposition which Faber made to him, but he
listened sympathetically none the less.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This would mean a definite refusal to Yonkers,&quot;
he said, and Faber agreed that it was so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what, Mr. Silvester. This affair has
cut pretty deep down into some of my old-fashioned
notions, and is costing me more than I care to tell
any man. I came across to Europe to pay a debt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
I owed to one who was my mother&#39;s friend. I meant
to reward him pretty liberally. And what have I
succeeded in doing after all? You know the story.
Paleologue lies dead up at Ranovica&mdash;the child&#39;s on
my yacht to judge me for what I&#39;ve done. Henceforth,
she is going to stand to me as my own daughter.
I shall spare no expense to educate and train her.
She&#39;ll have the best that money can buy; all that gives
a woman a chance in the world. If you will, you and
your daughter shall be my agents in this. Live where
you please, take the best house the agents can find for
you, spend all the money you can spend on making
her what I would wish her to be. You say the pastorate
has tired you out, and that you would like to
devote yourself to literature. Here&#39;s the chance of
your life time! Don&#39;t tell me that you will let it go
begging.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester knocked out the ashes of his pipe with
some deliberation. He was very much excited by the
offer, but at some pains to conceal his surprise at it.
Many schemes ran through his head&mdash;alas! none of
them had to do with Maryska de Paleologue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; he said, &quot;I could devote myself entirely
then to the I.A.L. It would be a great opportunity.
I can imagine no finer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is one finer, Mr. Silvester.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of what are you thinking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of a woman&#39;s soul&mdash;just the heart and the soul of
a little waif from the hills. She&#39;s a finer opportunity,
for she&#39;s flesh and blood. Your geese are all swans,
Mr. Silvester. You&#39;ll know as much when they fly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear you are as hostile to us as ever. Yet it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
seems to me&mdash;I say it with all reserve&mdash;that these
days should have done something for us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber thrust his hand deep into his pocket, and
bit into his cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;ve taught me nothing, except to say &#39;kismet.&#39;
Who knows truly how a man&#39;s destiny works? I
shall make Maryska de Paleologue one of the richest
women in Europe&mdash;well, there I come in. Money&#39;s
stronger than most things, and it&#39;s going to be stronger
than a man&#39;s death on this occasion. Wait until the
story is written, then we&#39;ll draw the moral.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you wish me to go to England at once?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow, in my yacht, if you can. I go to
Berlin to sign up a contract for rifles, but I expect
to be in London in a fortnight&#39;s time. You should
have your house then. There&#39;ll be no difficulty when
you show them the money. I leave all that to you
and to Miss Gabrielle. She&#39;s got to be the good angel
in this affair. I&#39;m counting on her right through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may well do that. She is a wonderful organizer;
no talk, no fuss. I am sure they would have
liked her in America if we had gone to Yonkers. As
it is, I really don&#39;t know what to say to those people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, tell them to go to hell!&quot; said Faber, while
he struck a match sharply and relighted his cigar.</p>

<p class="center">V</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Savannah</i> weighed at dawn, and all that day
they steamed by the glorious isles of the matchless
Adriatic. Their destination was Venice, whence Faber
would go via Munich to Berlin. The others were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
travel direct by the Simplon to London&mdash;all but Harry
Lassett, who meant to put in a few days at Montana
before he returned.</p>

<p class="indent">They carried a young doctor from Ragusa, but he
soon discovered that he had little to do save to take
a fee, a performance which he accomplished with truly
professional grace. Maryska had a heart of iron, it
appeared, and a constitution to match it. Whatever
the unnameable night had taught her of life or of men,
she held the damnable secret with the tenacity of a
race born to such acts and schooled in the creeds of
ferocity. Very silent, suspicious of all, agitated and
given to fits of trembling when alone, those with her
could not read that riddle of a child&#39;s dreams aright.
To Gabrielle she remained an enigma, seemingly wanting
in gratitude and anxious to escape every occasion
for it. Gordon Silvester she treated as though he did
not exist; Harry Lassett was a problem in manhood
to awake distrust and find her eyes furtive. John
Faber she trusted wholly.</p>

<p class="indent">They had allowed her to come on deck during the
heat of the day, and she lay there in a hammock swung
between hatches. An untamed restlessness found her
starting at every sound. She would sit up and watch
the passers-by as though afraid of them; or stare at
the crew with deeply black eyes, as though seeking a
friend among them. Her requests that Faber should
be sent to her were unceasing. In his turn, he liked
to hear her talk. He would watch those eloquent eyes,
and forget that she had called him &quot;an old, old man&quot;
in the early days of their acquaintance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you come and sit beside me, Mr. Faber, just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
a little while? I do not want the others to come. I
will not have them near me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Maryska, my dear, they just want to be kind
to you, that&#39;s all. Don&#39;t you like Miss Gabrielle,
now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thought about it. Then she said: &quot;Is she your
wife, Mr. Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My!&mdash;what an idea! I haven&#39;t got a wife. She&#39;s
engaged to the young man over there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not the one with the wolf&#39;s whiskers and the
teeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not; he&#39;s her father. The other one
who&#39;s playing with the quoits.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She watched Harry Lassett a little while; her face
became grave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>He</i> used to play that when last he came from
America. He played with me, and then I won money
for him from the others. We can&#39;t do that here; is
that right, Mr. Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed and took her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me tell you about this money, Maryska. Do
you know I&#39;m very rich, my dear? They call me one
of the richest men in the world. You mustn&#39;t think
about money any more. I&#39;ve got more than you and
I will ever spend if we live to be as old as Methuselah.
So just change the subject, little lady, and find another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made nothing of it, the years of the human
chase pursued her. Was she not alone now? <i>He</i>
could never help her again, and he had been so great
a part of her life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the good of telling me this? It is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
my money, Mr. Faber. I must go and get some for
myself when the ship stops. You had no right to
take me away from Ragusa&mdash;my home was there.
Why have you done it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He tried to tell her, but it was very difficult. In
some moods she was little better than a waif of the
streets, who had learned to beg like a mendicant at a
church door; in others her birthright gave her a
wonderful dignity before which the plebeian in John
Faber was dumb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want you to have a new home, Maryska, one
that you&#39;ll be glad to call your own. That&#39;s why I&#39;m
taking you to England. Miss Gabrielle there is going
to live with you and so&#39;s her father. But it will be
your own house and everything that&#39;s in it yours.
You&#39;ll like it, sure, when you see it, my dear. I
don&#39;t think you&#39;ll want to go back to Ragusa again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She listened pensively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will that boy be there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The one who&#39;s playing games?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, the boy who laughs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I dare say he&#39;ll come sometimes. Do you
like him, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know; he is very young, is he not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t asked his age, but I dare say he&#39;ll tell
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should not ask him. Men do not like to tell
their age. He never would. Why are you paying
for this house you speak of? You have no right to
pay for anything for me. You know that very well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The question gave him his opportunity, and he
told her as much of the story as she could comprehend.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
Her father had been the best friend he had ever
known. He had taken his mother to America at the
crisis of her fortunes. It was an obligation he could
never forget. He had meant to do so much in return,
but fate was against them both. They must act together
henceforth and make the best of their lives they
could. She must help him to honour his mother&#39;s
name. In her turn Maryska replied but vaguely. He
had thought that she was not listening, but when he
had finished, and following a little interval of silence,
she threw herself back upon her cushions and cried
wildly, &quot;Jesus Christ! I never had a mother to honour.&quot;
And that surely was as lamentable a confession
as any he had heard from her lips.</p>

<p class="center">VI</p>

<p class="indent">They were off Venice upon the following night,
and so favoured by fortune that the waxing moon
gave them a vista of the hundred isles, beautiful beyond
compare.</p>

<p class="indent">A still sea hardly stirred a ripple upon the sandy
shores of the Lido. Venice herself stood up in a haze
of soft light, her spires and domes rising above the
vast lagoon of untroubled waters, dim, mysterious,
entrancing. Seen from afar, she might have been a
great house of dreams; her windows so many stars
above a silent lake; her palaces but the dark clouds
of a vision. As phantoms about them, ships drifted
upon a reluctant tide; sails took shape and glided
away, spectres of an instant, into the deeper shadows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
There were musical voices crying out of the darkness;
notes of song most pleasing; the dwelling reverberations
of ancient bells to tell of hours which should
have been unnumbered. As they drew nearer still
and the Dogana took shape with the vast dome of
the Maria della Salute beyond it, then it was as though
the centuries spoke with one voice, and all the lustre
and the achievement of a thousand years were revealed
in a splendid instant. So is it ever for those
who approach Venice from the sea and obliterate
the black modernity which wrestles with her story.
Such is the vision of her which Turner beheld.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber watched the spectacle from the boat deck,
and was far from displeased to find Gabrielle at his
side. There had been few opportunities for confidential
talk since they sailed from Ragusa, and she herself
had said no word to lead him to believe that the
course of her life was about to be changed. Very
stately in mien this night, her height accentuated by
the place where she stood, her hair a little wild beneath
her wrap, eyes very bright and searching, her
manner restful, he wondered whence came the &quot;aristocrat&quot;
in her lineage, and how a mere manse had sent
forth such a missioner. Let the assembly be what it
might, Gabrielle Silvester would take a proud place.
Intellectually she was far above him in education and
artistic perception, but he suffered a sense of inferiority
with patience, and admired her the more because
she could awaken it. Bertie Morris had said
that she was &quot;cold and Saxon.&quot; Faber doubted the
truth of that.</p>

<p class="indent">They discussed many things in an ordinary way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
She spoke of the story of Venice and found him skilfully
parrying his own ignorance. He knew little of
the history of the place&mdash;had heard of St. Mark&#39;s and
of the &quot;Three.&quot; The lion&#39;s mouth struck him as a
fine idea. There ought to be one in every city for
cranks and faddists, he said, and a special box for
politicians and newspaper men. When she asked him
if the vision of the city suggested nothing more, he
thrust his hands into his pockets and said that it
reminded him of New York Bay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which is to say that all this talk of fine buildings
is so much flute blowing. I guess our people wouldn&#39;t
give New York second best if they spoke the whole
truth. You&#39;ll never admit as much yourself just because
you&#39;re full of Eastern prejudices. That&#39;s to be
expected. A thing which has stood a thousand years
has got the moss of the world&#39;s approval pretty
thick upon it. I take off my hat to Venice, but I&#39;m
thinking of New York all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of the temples of a mighty industry? Isn&#39;t that
in the advertisement line? I don&#39;t think you can be
quite serious, though. It must mean more to you
than that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should it mean more to me. I guess it&#39;s
brick and marble anyway, and not so very much better
because it&#39;s old. What we are seeing to-night comes
out of heaven&mdash;light and atmosphere and the sea for
a setting. I could show you a night in New York
Bay which is up to anything hereabouts. Why should
I spread myself when conviction isn&#39;t there? Yonder&#39;s
a beautiful city&mdash;is it worse because there are
others?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
Convention bade her smile, but she would yet try
to teach him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have no true inspiration,&quot; she said; &quot;there
will never be another great building in the world until
we find the key to the old. If a man&#39;s faith could
move mountains, he might build such a city as that.
But the faith must be there, I am sure of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meanwhile the world gets along very well on
stucco fronts. No one believes very much in anything
but money. You yourself are but half convinced, and
you want to make a convert of me. Now, isn&#39;t that
the truth, Miss Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was very angry with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You rich men have no ideals. You discredit the
ideals of others. If I had your money, I would build
such a temple to peace as would compel the world to
come in. Oh! think what one might do, the name
one might leave, the homes one might save. It is
money that hides all this from you, money that hides
even the purpose of life itself. You grub in the valleys
when imagination should lead you to the hill-top.
Your eyes look downwards&mdash;how shall anyone
teach you to see?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He smoked on patiently. Presently, he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s something in the Bible about the blind
leading the blind. I&#39;ll tell you what. You are trying
to convince yourself about this peace nonsense, and
in the end you may succeed. When you do, I&#39;ll build
your temple for you; it&#39;s a promise between us, and
shall be kept. The heretic building the church for the
faithful; I like the idea of that, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will never build it,&quot; she said. &quot;I have come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
to know that now. You have not the imagination to
build; nothing teaches you in spirit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then she exclaimed with very real conviction:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a man without pity for humanity&mdash;all
your story is told in that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He accepted the savage assault with a smile that
was unchanging. Candour in women pleased him; as
his wife, this woman would carry him far upon an
unfamiliar road his ambition had often sought. In the
vulgar phrase, she would bring culture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I may be without pity for humanity,&quot; he said,
&quot;but humanity&#39;s had a good many dollars out of my
pocket. Do you know how much humanity I employ
at Charleston, I wonder? Well, all told, I dare say
there are some nine thousand hands, all eating and
drinking at the expense of the man whom nothing
touches in spirit. When I&#39;m dead, maybe I&#39;ll write
as good an epitaph as your friends who blow other
people&#39;s trumpets and give their money for the archangels
who don&#39;t exist. Anyway, I&#39;ll let the record
stand, and as to this temple of yours, I&#39;ll build it all
right, and you shall have it as a wedding present.
Can I say fairer than that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up quickly, her face flushed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you speak of a wedding present?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I must make haste to do what I ought
to have done long ago, and congratulate you&mdash;of
course, I did not know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed rather hardly. Very wonderful castles
were falling all about her, and a woman&#39;s chagrin did
not help her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were both very ignorant,&quot; she said helplessly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
He watched her closely. &quot;A very old friend, Mr.
Lassett, isn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have known him all my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that is the sure way of knowing him better.
Did I hear he was a cricketer? I thought he said
something of the kind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is one of the greatest cricketers England has
had. Anything else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, no; well, I congratulate you. You&#39;ll be
married, I suppose, before we meet again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was surprised at this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you not coming to see Maryska?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When she asks for me, yes; but I know the sex.
She&#39;ll have forgotten my name in a month&#39;s time; it
is the privilege of women.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And in that case&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;I shall be in America building my
temple. It&#39;s steel mostly, and butters a good deal of
humanity&#39;s bread.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was very much perplexed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maryska will never like that. I am sure she will
be very unhappy without you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t agree,&quot; he said, and bade her listen.</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of young voices came up to them from
the cabin. Harry Lassett was talking to Maryska,
and when she answered him, there was a little ripple
of girlish laughter, which seemed to say that she had
found a friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t agree,&quot; Faber repeated, and then with some
sternness, he added: &quot;Mr. Lassett is teaching her
cricket, I suppose. Well, that&#39;s a game I&#39;d rather she
didn&#39;t learn!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-6" id="ch2-6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">GOODWILL TOWARD MEN</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">Faber arrived in Berlin three days after the yacht
had put into Venice. The cordiality of his reception
in the German capital surprised him. Known both as
the inventor and the manufacturer of the famous
&quot;Faber&quot; magazine rifle, the greatest instrument of
war the twentieth century had yet seen, he found
himself a celebrity most welcome to the Germans.
Rarely had there been so much &quot;hoching&quot; for a comparatively
private individual. Remarkable personages
in remarkable uniforms overwhelmed him by their
hospitality; he was made familiar with superb &quot;vons&quot;
in accoutrement more superb. The gay city&mdash;by far
the gayest in Europe at the present time&mdash;delighted
him by its capacity for enjoyment and its freedom
from social cant. The women flirted with him outrageously.
He had never been made so much of since
fortune first smiled upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie Morris came from Paris on the fourth day,
and brought him all the news in exchange for his own.
Bertie was not surprised that Faber&#39;s first question
should be about little Claudine d&#39;Arny, and what had
happened to her since the tragedy of her father&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
death. He had come to Berlin prepared to give a
good account of his stewardship in that affair, and he
was very proud of what he had done. They were
at dinner when the narration took place, and the restaurant
of the Metropole Hotel glowed with light and
colour, and the glitter of fine uniforms. There were
officers everywhere; women whose gowns neither
Paris nor Vienna might shame. They moved in an
atmosphere of soft tints; the warmth of crimson carpets
and the spotless white of polished walls setting
off their &quot;creations&quot; to perfection. The air was heavy
with the scent of crimson roses, which were on every
table, despite the season.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber had a table in the corner of the room, and
he allowed <i>hors-d&#39;&oelig;uvre</i> and soup to be served before
he interrupted the journalist in his occupation of criticising
the company with that running and often ironical
commentary in which writing people delight.
When the prettiest women had been &quot;sized-up,&quot; famous
people reduced to pulp, and the European situation
dismissed in twenty words, Bertie was ready to
speak of Claudine. He was too good an actor to bring
her on the scene before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She arrived at Cannes yesterday,&quot; he said at last.
&quot;I chose the Riviera Palace because it&#39;s the kind of
hotel where she&#39;ll meet the most people, and forget
the quickest. Of course, Issy-Ferrault is going. It
was difficult enough to do your business, but I did
it bluntly in a business way. &#39;Marry Claudine d&#39;Arny,&#39;
I said, &#39;and she&#39;ll have a guaranteed income of one
hundred and twenty-five thousand francs a year.&#39; His
own douceur was to be another hundred and twenty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
thousand paid on the day the contract was signed.
I put it to him as plainly as if I had a picture to sell.
In the end, he bought her with no more scruple than
if she had been a horse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blustering first; I suppose, and talking of his ancestry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think&mdash;there was about an hour and a
half of it. Issy-Ferrault came out of the history
box like pepper out of a pot. You&#39;d have thought
they made France and that Charlemagne was a bagman.
When he was through with his talking, I just
put the cinch on him with the remark that he wasn&#39;t
writing history books but contracts. He pumped me
like a tax-gatherer to learn the why and wherefore
of it all; but the most I could tell him was that an
old friend of Claudine&#39;s was determined to see her
through and that good hard dollars expressed the
measure of his determination. There I left it, and
that&#39;s what he signed upon. He&#39;ll go to Cannes and
marry her directly public opinion will let him do it.
They are to live in London, I understand. He&#39;s a
good sportsman and is out after the English shooting
and fishing, so I told him to get a house in the
shires, and he promised to do so. Claudine&#39;s money
will tie him up all right&mdash;and as for that, I should
think a girl with those eyes could hold most men. You
may take it, Faber, that the matter is settled&mdash;as, of
course, it was bound to be&mdash;after your generosity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber brushed the suggestion aside as one which
hardly concerned him. He was pleased by the news
and his pride stirred at the suggestion of power, the
reality of which he began to understand. Who but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
a man of vast fortune could have repaired such a
tragedy as that? He looked Destiny full in the face
and laughed at its omens.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve bought most things,&quot; he said, &quot;but this is
my first deal in husbands. Well, I&#39;m glad the little
girl is on the road again. Isn&#39;t this Issy-Ferrault
rather a hustler in his way? I heard him well spoken
of when I was in Paris; they say he&#39;s an aeroplane
on the road or in the air. Do you know of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, there&#39;s some talk. He was with Bl√©riot a
month or two back. The French army does not sleep
much nowadays&mdash;a pretty wide-awake lot without
any whiskers on their ideas. Issy-Ferrault is one of
the aviation detachment. I suppose he&#39;ll be flying
on his own account now if he can keep out of the arms
of that black-eyed little girl. But he won&#39;t, if I&#39;m
any judge of women. She&#39;ll stick like the best glue;
she&#39;s just the sort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you haven&#39;t altered your opinion of her since
we left Paris?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guess not; nor of your flaxen-haired Venus
either. You don&#39;t tell me, by the way, what&#39;s become
of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s gone to London to get married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie opened his eyes very wide.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To get married! Who&#39;s the man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a boy&mdash;knocks balls about and considers
himself famous. Just one of these British boys, nice
voice and manners, and legs like the Moses in the
pictures. I don&#39;t think you would have named him
for her choice in twenty guesses, but there it is.
They&#39;ve been billing and cooing on the Adriatic for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
a week, and now they&#39;ve gone to do it in London.
They&#39;re a difficult proposition, Bertie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie, watching him shrewdly, guessed the same.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she in love with him&mdash;real?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask me something else. She&#39;s a woman, and
being a woman, many sided. One side likes being
kissed on the lips by twenty-two, who must be big-limbed
and masculine. The other sides are turned
toward various objects&mdash;ambition, money, and a
woman&#39;s common vanities. She&#39;s at an age when
they turn like a wind vane, and as often. If he
catches her in a calm, he&#39;ll marry her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if he doesn&#39;t&mdash;well, that&#39;s in the air. You
were speaking of Rupert Trevelle a while back. He&#39;s
over there in the corner yonder. Shall I introduce
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber looked up and saw a man of about his own
age, faultlessly dressed, and accompanied by two
pretty women in the smartest gowns. Trevelle, by
his looks, should either have been a major of a smart
cavalry regiment, or in &quot;the diplomatic.&quot; He had
jet black hair and a fierce moustache, large manners
and a habit of authority. His party, like their own,
had just finished dinner, and presently they all found
themselves in the lounge where mutual introductions
were made.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My friend, Mr. John Faber, of Charleston, the
Baroness von Hartmann, Lady Florentine. This is
Mr. Rupert Trevelle, of whom Sir Jules Achon has
spoken. So now we all know each other and may
get down to business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie placed chairs for the party, and with one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
of his characteristic &quot;Shall we&#39;s,&quot; he ordered coffee
and liqueurs. Faber found himself between Trevelle
and the baroness&mdash;a woman with a milk-white skin
she was at no pains to conceal, and a method of crushing
her handkerchief in a fat hand which was quite
deadly with young men. She spoke little English,
but that was sufficient to convey to the somewhat reserved
American an intimation of possible weakness
under pleasant conditions and of her own indifference
to the absurdities of some modern conventions. Trevelle,
on the other hand, had great news, and he bestowed
it as gracious manna upon a field of fertile
flirtation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are talking of you at the Embassy to-night,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber merely retorted, &quot;Why, is that so?&quot; and
edged a little farther from the baroness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, it was very much so. You know that
you are to have the White Cross of Prussia?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s fine news. Has Sir Jules got anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing whatever. They don&#39;t give white
crosses for ideas, more&#39;s the pity. Jules Achon is a
great man&mdash;the world will find it out some day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The sooner the better for its credit. What you
have to do, Mr. Trevelle, is to educate the people;
but I&#39;m telling you nothing new. You know that as
well as I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most certainly I do; I have told Sir Jules so
some ten thousand times. He has a great idea, but
he must have public opinion behind it. The people
make war to-day, not the princes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But princes have a say in it, sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
&quot;They do when the people are willing that they
should. At present the popular mind is pretty well
where it was fifty years ago. Look at the reputation
you bear in Berlin. Why? Because you have made
an instrument which allows the German to kill his
enemies as he has never been killing them before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are saying, vat?&quot; asked the baroness, impatient
of neglect. &quot;You are telling Mister Faber to kill
ze enemies?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of his own sex, madame,&quot; retorted Trevelle immediately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then he is not like ze Spanish king, who do not
kill his enemy because he have killed him already.
I should be afraid of this friend of yours; he have
nothing but killing in his mind&mdash;he live to kill, is it
not so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Trevelle, &quot;you must ask the ladies about
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The baroness shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We was all to go to the Alcazar to see the Russian
dancers. Why do we stay? I am all hot. I would
get far from here&mdash;all hot, and yet they say dat in
England is joost one good big cold, so cold dat ze nose
is freeze off the face. Shall we go to dance, Mr.
Trevelle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle said, &quot;Certainly.&quot; He had heard of the
terrible winter they were having in England, and was
glad not to be in London.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Thames will be frozen right over,&quot; he told
them, &quot;the first time since the beginning of the nineteenth
century. I suppose there is something in this
story of the weakening of the Gulf Stream after two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
years of drought over yonder. Anyway, it&#39;s extraordinary.
I wonder what would happen if the Channel
froze&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Faber, &quot;a good many people would
wonder then, and some of them would be in Berlin.
I don&#39;t think Sir Jules&#39;s stock would stand very high
if that happened, Mr. Trevelle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you think it quite impossible?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which is to say that I dictate to Nature. Well,
I don&#39;t think I should do that at my time of life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They all laughed, and went off to the Alcazar,
where a Russian woman danced divinely, and was
followed by a red-nosed man, who broke plates to the
great delight of an immense audience. Faber was not
displeased to find himself with these two pretty women
in a box, where all the world could see him; and it
occurred to him before he had been there very long
that the house had recognised him, and that he was
being pointed out to other pretty women in the seats
below. Certainly, this visit to Berlin was becoming
a famous thing in its way. It compelled him to understand
the meaning of that fame he had won for himself
and the homage paid both to him and to his house.
A glamour of life, unknown hitherto, but very dazzling,
could influence even so balanced a judgment and
so cynical a student of humanity. Hardly one of the
women, rustling in silks and velvets, bedizened in
jewels&mdash;hardly one of them to whom he might not
have thrown the handkerchief, if he would. The
knowledge flattered his pride, and set him thinking of
Gabrielle Silvester. Well dressed and wonderful as
these women were, Gabrielle would have held her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
among them all. He thought of her as destined to
rule amid a glitter of jewels and an incense of roses.
There was no house in all Europe she could not grace,
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">A vain thought. She was engaged to a fool of a
boy, who could play cricket; and that very night upon
his return to the hotel, he found a letter from her in
which she confessed to the folly without excuse.
Harry wished for an early day. He had altered his
plans, and thought now that he would not go to Australia.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">Faber read the letter in a deep chair by the fireside&mdash;in
his private room at the Metropole. Bertie
Morris, meanwhile, had the English newspaper and a
very large whisky and soda. Both men had caught
the Berlin habit, and lived rather by night than by
day. The hotel itself was then, at a quarter to one
in the morning, beginning to amuse itself seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle wrote a pretty hand, round as her own
limbs, precise as her own habits, with here and there
a fine flourish to denote a certain want of stability.
It was to be expected that she would make early
mention of her charge; but she dwelt so insistently
upon what Maryska de Paleologue had done that she
must have presupposed an interest beyond the common.
And then there was the postscript&mdash;a word of
real alarm or of deep design. Faber readily granted
the former, and would have nothing to do with the
latter. Gabrielle was transparently honest in all that
she said and wrote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
&quot;We arrived in London after a bitter journey,&quot;
the letter ran, &quot;the frost has returned, and the cold
is dreadful. I am afraid Maryska feels it very much
after Ragusa, and is not grateful to us for bringing
her to such an inhospitable country. The streets of
London shone like rivers of ice as we drove through,
and even my father now admits that there is something
in a taxi. What Maryska does not understand
is your threatened journey to America, and your unkindness
in leaving us all with so brief a farewell.
She is very strange here, and she is entirely without
friends&mdash;though Harry has done his best to cheer her
up, and has really developed surprising powers as a
private entertainer. Perhaps the cold and the fog have
affected her spirits unduly&mdash;I would not make too
much of it, but she is undoubtedly changed since we
left Venice, and the change is not for the better! This
much you ought to know.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, it is much too early yet to speak of
the house. We are all at Hampstead in the old home,
and it seems difficult to believe that so much has
happened in so short a time. I refuse to allow that
Christmas Day falls next week, and that in twelve days
we shall be ringing the old year out. If anything
could convince me it is this bitter cold, this biting
cruel weather, which is like nothing England has seen
before, and I hope will be like nothing that is to come
after. Here at Hampstead, they say the ice is inches
thick upon the ponds&mdash;I can hear the whir of the
skates from my windows, and everyone who passes
is dressed like a grizzly bear. Maryska has seen a
severe winter in America, and suffered terribly there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
because of the cold. So you will understand how
anxious we are about her, and how very watchful it
is necessary to be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father says she is the strangest compound
of oddities he has ever encountered. It is a description
which does less than justice to an original character.
Of religion she has none. Her god is an oath&mdash;nothing
more: and yet to say that she is without a
deep capacity of feeling would be untrue. Some of
her ideas are fantastic&mdash;I suppose the orthodox would
call them barbarous. She has a locket about her throat
with a miniature of the Crucifixion after Francesco.
I know that she has painted out the face of Christ, and
made a crude likeness of her father in its place. Her
trunk is full of his drawings&mdash;there are hardly any
clothes, poor child, and we shall have to fit her out
directly she is well enough. By that time we should
know where we are to live, if I can persuade my
father to see the house agents. He has a morbid idea
that he will commit some great mistake, and I should
not be surprised if he took a good many houses before
the New Year.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The only other news is that Harry does not now
think that he will go to Australia. He appears to be
capricious in his new ideas, and is ready to insist upon
a crisis in our affairs. This is so wholly unexpected,
that I do not know what to say about it. The foundations
of the Temple are not laid, and it would be
terrible if the building fell. I suppose it is all very
serious, and I should consider it in that light, but I
remain an enigma to myself, and am content to let
the future speak for itself.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
&quot;Oh, how cold it is&mdash;how cruelly cold! I can write
no more, even by a warm fireside. Perhaps Maryska
will write herself soon&mdash;horrible thought, I have yet
to learn if the child can write at all. When she reads,
she terrifies me with the possibilities. Her acquaintance
with the most dreadful words is a daily fright to
me! She speaks Italian and French quite fluently, and
another language which my father does not recognise,
but thinks may be Roumanian. He brought a
professor of Oriental languages from one of the Universities
here yesterday, but the poor man was utterly
at sea. I am sure he did not understand a single word
of what she said&mdash;none knew that better than clever
Maryska!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is asking for you every day, and I must tell
her that you are going to America. It is a heavy
burden upon my poor shoulders. Yesterday she said,
&#39;Even <i>his</i> friend has gone away.&#39; So, you see, she
knows that you were his friend, and I am sure that
will not be unwelcome to you.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Believe me, with all our kindest regards,</p>

<p class="cnobmargin">&quot;Dear Mr. Faber, yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Gabrielle Silvester</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;P.S.&mdash;The news is not so well to-night. We
have had another day of the damp cold, and I am
seriously alarmed for her. Have we done right to
bring such a hot-house plant to England at all? She
is asking for you again even as I write, for she knows
that it is written. &#39;Tell him,&#39; she says, &#39;that <i>he</i> would
have wished it. Then he will come to me.&#39; I am
doing my duty even if it be done without hope.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span></p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie Morris drained his glass and then folded the
paper he had been reading with great nicety. The
journalistic habit inspired a restless curiosity which
would probe even the intimate affairs of his friends.
He knew that the letter was of great importance, and
was almost indignant that his great friend did not
speak of its contents.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; he said, with a pretence of a yawn, &quot;I
suppose it&#39;s time for me to be trotting. See you to-morrow,
anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber thrust the letter into his breast coat pocket
and lighted a new cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I am here, why, yes; maybe I&#39;ll not be here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll not be here! But haven&#39;t you an appointment
with General Heinstein, to say nothing of the
Count?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An excellent pair; they can amuse my man of
business. I guess I&#39;m going to England.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie whistled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t toe the mark for any ceremony, Faber.
What about this White Cross?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let them hang it round the neck of the little
girl at the Alcazar. I&#39;ve seen the Emperor, the one
big man in this country, perhaps the one big man in
Europe, unless you care to name Kitchener. The others
are no good to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you&#39;ll be going sure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not sure at all. See me in the morning, and I&#39;ll
write the bulletin. Just at the moment I&#39;m thinking
about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
&quot;Well, I hope you won&#39;t go, anyway. If you do,
so long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He put on his hat slowly as though still hoping
to hear the reason why. That the &quot;flaxen-haired Venus&quot;
had something to do with it Bertie Morris was
convinced; and being a mere man, conviction amused
him. Had Faber said a word to invite his confidence,
he would have spoken freely enough. What
was this multi-millionaire, who might marry where
he pleased in any famous family in Europe, what
was he doing in the company of a mere parson&#39;s
daughter? Here, in Berlin, Bertie could have named
half a dozen high and mighty personages, beautiful
women with wonderful swan-like necks and the blood
of bountiful barons in their delicate veins, who would
have packed their traps like one o&#39;clock had John
Faber but dropped a handkerchief in their path. And
here he was, restless and uneasy and stark indifferent
to his social opportunities in the German capital, just
because a tall girl with flaxen hair had preached sermons
upon peace to him, and rubbed in the moral with
some meaning glances from far from inexpressive
eyes. Bertie could not make head or tail of such
primitive passions, and he gave up the business as
incomprehensible.</p>

<p class="indent">He had left Faber upon a note of interrogation,
and to the man chiefly concerned it was a perplexing
note enough. Should he go to England because this
little waif of the world had called him, or should he
leave her to forget, as forget she must before many
weeks had run? If he went, he would recreate for
himself all those difficulties he experienced when in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
the presence of Gabrielle and of her sometimes inexplicable
charm. That she was drifting, drifting into the
marriage with Harry Lassett, he would not deny. The
tragedy of her life might be the consummation of that
marriage based upon the passion of an hour and
doomed to perish as swiftly. Dimly he perceived the
truth about himself and about her. Both had been
tempted by a physical instinct&mdash;both were born to a
destiny more spiritual. He himself had stood for an
instant toward Maryska de Paleologue as Gabrielle
towards this very human boy. And the child had
called him &quot;an old, old man,&quot; awakening realities with
her words and opening his eyes as no other had dared
to do.</p>

<p class="indent">Long he debated it, perplexed beyond experience.
Should he go to England, and if he did, what then?
Day did not help him, nor the early hours of a
busy morning. It was not until he had lunched that
they handed him a cable from Gabrielle, and he knew
that the argument was ended.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is very much worse. I think you had better
come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So the cable ran. He caught the night mail, and
was at Ostend upon the following morning.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3-1" id="ch3-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">THE MEMORABLE WINTER</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">The leap into the dark is made willy-nilly by every
passenger who steps upon a mail boat at night and
asks no preliminary question concerning the weather.</p>

<p class="indent">What a spectacle it is of ease buffeted by necessity
at the harbour station; of luxury driven out howling
to the rigour of a raw and relentless atmosphere; of
gregarious humanity sent as sheep to the slaughter
or the satiety of the elements. Here comes the train
blazing with lights. The passengers wake from their
unsettled slumbers to de-wrap and thrust anxious
faces from the carriage windows. They call for porters
in many tongues, and porters often enough are not
vouchsafed to them. There is a dreadful confusion
upon the platform&mdash;the strong pressing upon the weak,
the helpless giving place to the cunning, the rich wondering
that they cannot bribe the sea. So we go to
the ship lying as a phantom at the wharf. She must
laugh at all this humanity so suddenly uncoddled.
It is little to her whether the night be fine or windy.
She has no rugs to cast aside, and the porters can do
nothing for her.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber was an expert traveller, and his man, Frank,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
a paragon. He found a cabin reserved for him upon
the steamer <i>City of Berlin</i>, and was surprised when
making his way below to rub shoulders with Rupert
Trevelle, the last person he believed to be on the train
from the capital. Trevelle, old hand that he was, admitted
that he had been caught napping this time, and
was without a berth. It was the most obvious thing
to offer him one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come right along with me&mdash;I always book a second
bunk, and you&#39;re welcome to it. You didn&#39;t say
last night you were going across?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hadn&#39;t heard from Sir Jules then. It&#39;s his business
which is taking me. He&#39;s thinking of going to
St. Petersburg.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A wonderful man, sir!&mdash;this appears to be our
den. Come right in, and when the ship starts we&#39;ll
get some cigars and some claret if they&#39;ve any aboard.
Ever try claret against sea-sickness? It&#39;s the finest
thing in the world! I&#39;ll give you a dose just now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle laughed, and began to dispose his things
about the cabin. It was the best on the ship, and the
beds looked inviting enough. He, however, had the
Berlin habit, and would gladly make a dawn of it.
It was a wonderful piece of good luck that he should
have happened upon this amazing man, who went
through the world on the magic carpet of luxury.
Trevelle determined that John Faber was the man
for him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know about claret, but a little rye whisky
would suit me very well. You&#39;re going through to
London, of course?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As the crow does not fly this odd weather. Sit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
down and take your boots off. I&#39;m Western enough
to know the road to comfort, and boots don&#39;t carry
you far along it. We&#39;ll make ourselves snug while
Frank is putting the fear of God into the steward.
Go right slick, my boy, and let us hear the sound of
corks. We shall want all the warmth we can get
before we make Dover harbour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle assented to that. He had already lighted
a cigar and was deep down in an unprotesting bed.
Soon glasses rattled in the cabin, and the well-desired
music of corks was to be heard. The steamer moved
slowly from her moorings: they had sailed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So Sir Jules is going to St. Petersburg? Does it
strike you as not a little extraordinary that this great
man, who has the sanest ideas about the peace question
of anyone alive, should be wandering about Europe
in this way, knocking at every door like a weary
evangelist? To me, it&#39;s a sad sight, sir. I wish I
could do something to make it better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I, not less,&quot; said Trevelle. &quot;Do you think, though,
that the world is very much in love with sane ideas
just now? I don&#39;t. You hit the multitude either
with fact or fiction. The <i>via media</i> leads nowhere.
Sir Jules says to these people, &#39;I can give you peace,
but my scheme may take twenty years to mature.&#39; So
they think in a twenty years&#39; measure!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meanwhile the other man, who says &#39;Here is
the millennium, take it!&#39;&mdash;he is on the first floor. None
the less, I would go on if I were Sir Jules. He&#39;s got
a real good thing. When he&#39;s advertised it long
enough, the public will know it&#39;s real good, and he&#39;ll
get a hearing. I said and I repeat: &#39;Educate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
people&mdash;the others wouldn&#39;t let you educate &#39;em, if
you could.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle laughed at that.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you&#39;d come in yourself,&quot; he said, falling
suddenly to great earnestness. &quot;By gad! that would
be a coup for Sir Jules! Have you ever thought about
it, Mr. Faber? You are one of the few who could
really help him. Why not come and form an international
committee? You could work the American
end yourself&mdash;no one better! I&#39;m sure it must be some
interest to America to see a final settlement in Europe,
even if she has to make sacrifices to obtain it. Now,
won&#39;t you think of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber seemed very much amused. He had expected
this request from one or the other, but he recognised
now that Sir Jules had been too shrewd to
make it. Why, the very essence of his scheme was an
assault upon American enterprise. It required this
undaunted hustler to put the thing in plain terms&mdash;he
liked Trevelle none the less for his effrontery.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll think of it all right,&quot; he said, still smiling;
&quot;perhaps I can see myself upon an American platform
telling my fellow countrymen that the only way to
keep Europeans from cutting each other&#39;s throats is
to tax our goods another twenty per cent. That&#39;s the
pith of Sir Jules&#39;s proposal. Free trade in Europe as
a federated state&mdash;no more internecine rivalry. All
brothers, except when the United States are on hand.
You save your war bills because you fight for commercial
reasons nowadays, and there won&#39;t be any
commercial rivalries there. Well, I don&#39;t think it
would do on my side, great as it is here. Make a federated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
state of Europe, if you like, but my countrymen
would sooner federate Christ and His disciples.
That&#39;s an honest truth, sir. I do believe my country
is averse to war, because Almighty God has taught
her to be so. I am thankful that it should be so, and
yet I don&#39;t put human nature on too high a pedestal,
and I believe America would fight to-morrow if a
slap in her face rang loud enough. That&#39;s why I go
on making guns for a living. I don&#39;t want to see men
shot any more than any other man; but I do hold that
the fighting instinct is deep down in the heart of every
man, and that you will require some centuries yet to
root it out. My gospel&#39;s there in so many words&mdash;I&#39;m
too old to alter it, and some of you will say I make
too much money out of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle expected nothing less, but he still persisted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What then of the others&mdash;of Carnegie and the
arbitration movement, and all that? Do you turn
your back on them also?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never turn my back on brains wherever I find
them. These earnest men, some of them men of genius,
are educating the people of the whole world. I wish
them God-speed! They are as truly defending their
country as the man who holds a rifle. Their enemy
is the brute beast, born in us from the beginning.
They have to cast out devils&mdash;there&#39;s one in every
man&#39;s story, but the best of us keep him under. It&#39;s
just because there are others that men like myself are
necessary. We bring brains into the argument&mdash;no
country was yet saved without them, or ever will
be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which is as much as to say that you do your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
work in your own way. America first in your mind
all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the time, sir, except when I go to England,
as now, to do what I can for those who may have
need of me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Privately, of course, Mr. Faber&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Both privately and publicly, Mr. Trevelle, if the
occasion should arise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah,&quot; said Trevelle, &quot;you are thinking what might
happen if this frost should bring a panic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am thinking of nothing else, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>City of Berlin</i> slowed down very much as they
drew near to Dover, and even those in the private
cabins became aware that something unusual was happening.
Loud cries were heard from the bridge, and
then heavy blows upon the steel plates&mdash;repeated
while the ship shivered and trembled, and the dullest
intellect awakened. As it was not yet light, none of
those who ventured from their beds to the decks could
make much of the circumstance; but when dawn
broke, the state of affairs was revealed, and surely it
was significant.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber had not closed his eyes during the first four
hours of the passage, and he and Trevelle went out
to the upper deck together directly the light broke.
They were off the Goodwins then, upon a sea so still
that the rising sun made of it one vast and silvered
mirror. From an almost cloudless sky above a powder
of snow fell, as showers in summer from the blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
ether. Not a breath of wind appeared to be stirring;
the air was like ice upon the cheek; the whole atmosphere
ominously still.</p>

<p class="indent">The men had lighted cigars, and they walked aft
to peer down into the white water and learn what
secrets it had to yield. An old salt, round-barrelled
and full of wise saws, a man who had spent a long
life upon that narrow sea which girds the silver isle,
edged up to them, and for once in a way uttered sentiments
which had not possible half-crowns behind
them. He was genuinely astonished; &quot;took all aback,&quot;
and not ashamed to say so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s ice, gentlemen, that&#39;s wot it were. I seed it
with these eyes, and I&#39;ve been looking down into that
waterway nigh four and forty year. Ice off the Goodwins:
d&mdash;&mdash;n me, who&#39;d believe it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess some of them will have to believe it,&quot;
said Faber dryly, &quot;unless the weather keeps them out.
You don&#39;t see any sign of a break, eh, my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see no sign at all, sir, not as big as a
man&#39;s hand. The wind&#39;s from north by east, and
little to speak of. Who&#39;s to change it? Would you
kindly tell me that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don&#39;t look at me,&quot; exclaimed Trevelle with
a laugh. &quot;I&#39;m not a bagman in weather. So far as
my memory goes, there was a good deal of ice in the
English Channel somewhere about 1820, and a very
little in the year 1887&mdash;I&#39;ve read it somewhere. You
don&#39;t remember that, my man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old fellow spat into the sea with some contempt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As much ice as you could put down a woman&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
back. I remember 1887 well enough. The Thames
was nigh froze, and there was a fringe of summat
they called &#39;ice&#39; right round by Herne Bay and all
the way to Dover. But this here&#39;s more than a bucketful,
gentlemen&mdash;by gosh! it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He jumped involuntarily as a floe, some yards
wide, struck the steamer and set the metal reverberating.
All on deck ran to the side and watched the
dirty ice bobbing like a human thing in the vessel&#39;s
wash, and then drifting upon the tide over toward
Cape Grisnez. Hardly had it passed when the captain
rang an order from the bridge, and the ship went
to dead slow. Another floe had been sighted ahead,
and it was large enough to provoke greater wonder;
a mass of black ice as though coming down from a
considerable field over yonder towards the land. The
ship passed by this and began to swing round to make
Dover Harbour. The cold seemed to be increasing
with every knot they made. Such an experience upon
the English shore was within the knowledge of no
living man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve been up to the ice-blink twice, and I was in
Alaska three years ago,&quot; said Trevelle. &quot;This beats
anything I have seen, easily. What would you say
the temperature was, Mr. Faber?&mdash;phenomenal without
doubt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About as many degrees below zero as you can
get into a common swear word. Look yonder on the
shore. Is that ice or am I dreaming it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s ice right enough! Hi, my man, that&#39;s ice
by the harbour wall, isn&#39;t it? Good God, what a
sight! In the English Channel, too!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
The sailor enjoyed this spontaneous tribute to the
eccentricities of nature. He thought he would catch
them upon an exclamation sooner or later, and he did
so triumphantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The harbour&#39;s going to be froze,&quot; he said sardonically;
&quot;they&#39;ll be cutting of it with sardine-openers&mdash;at
least they were a-talking about it. You could
walk as far as the bathing machines gin&#39;rilly git out.
I dare say you&#39;ll see some of &#39;em a-doing it now if
your eyes are good enough. They tell me it&#39;s the
Gulf Stream what&#39;s responsible. Well, d&mdash;&mdash;n the
Gulf Stream! say I, and that&#39;s all about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His peculiarities produced no other effect than the
<i>sotto voce</i> of a chaplain&#39;s lady, who thought that he
was a very wicked man. The others were far too
much interested in the unusual appearance of Dover
Harbour and the environs to take any notice of such
emphasis. Early as it was, groups of boys and lads
sported with hard ice which ran right round the seawall,
and even floated in great lumps in the mouths
of the basins. Rills of waves ran, not upon a beach
of shingle, but over the frozen waters, spreading as
molten silver and often freezing as they ran. There
were effects of the frost most bizarre&mdash;buoys covered
with the hoar, ropes of ice where ladders stood, vast
stalactites as of pure crystal from the roof of every
walled bay into which the sea ran. The cold, still air
breathed upon all as with the breath of the Arctic
wastes. The town of Dover was frozen out from the
heights of the Castle Hill to the very depths of its
meanest streets.</p>

<p class="indent">They went ashore over a gangway dusted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
sand that they might obtain a foothold upon it. They
had thought that it would be warmer off the sea,
but when the train moved away and they crossed the
frozen fields of Kent, a new rigour penetrated the
ill-warmed carriages and seemed to search their very
bones. At Dover newsboys had cried the morning
papers with the latest news of the phenomenal frost
and of the rumours of a great strike of transport
workers following upon it. It seemed to be the one
topic of conversation in the train and out of it. Great
experts in meteorology had been interviewed in London,
in Vienna, in New York. They agreed that England
was suffering this abnormal spell because of the
reduced flow of her old friend, the Gulf Stream.
There could be no other logical conclusion, and the
best that could be said was that the severity of the
visitation was the soundest argument for its speedy
disappearance.</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle read all this out to his companion in the
reserved compartment which carried them to Victoria.
He seemed willing to be impressed by such authorities
and was amazed to find that his companion differed
from him absolutely. Faber confessed that he
had looked for such a winter in England and would
have been surprised at any other. His manner had
become a little restless again, and he was very anxious
for the journey to terminate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are going to have a lively time in London,&quot;
he said. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll be caught in this pit after all,
and pretty warm it will be for some of them. Do
you know how much wheat your country wants every
week to feed its people, Mr. Trevelle? I&#39;ve figured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
it out, and it seems to me it&#39;s somewhere about five
million bushels; that&#39;s wheat alone, to say nothing of
an Englishman&#39;s roast beef and what goes with it.
Well, I suppose you&#39;ve food enough in the country
for three weeks at a press. Perhaps you have and
perhaps you haven&#39;t. Let this frost hold and the strike
continue in my country, which I hear is likely, and
you&#39;re going to see the biggest panic in London you
ever saw in all your life. I had a notion of it when
I was last here and I mentioned it to some of them.
Professor Geikie, of St. Louis, first put it into my
head as long ago as last October, when he was taking
observations of the Gulf Stream for the Shippers&#39;
Institute of the southern ports; he noticed this check
in the flow. &#39;Let it go on,&#39; he said, &#39;and they&#39;ll have
a winter in Britain which will be memorable.&#39; I knew
the professor and put my money behind him. You&#39;ve
got the winter, and you&#39;re only at the beginning of it.
God knows when it will end or how, but I&#39;d be glad
to be out of this country if I could, and that&#39;s sure.
It&#39;s too late to think of that, now, however.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you seriously believe then that the wheat supply
from your side will fail?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s failing already&mdash;the cables tell me so. Great
extremities of temperature are as sure a call to discontented
labour as the spring to the cuckoo. Let
this go on a week and there&#39;ll be something like a
national panic. Then you&#39;ll see who believes in universal
peace, and I guess you&#39;ll see it quick. For my
part, if I were a free agent, I&#39;d pack and be off to-night.
But I&#39;m not a free agent, and there&#39;s work for
me to do; mighty serious work, I know. Perhaps I&#39;ll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
ask you to help me. You&#39;re just the man for the job.
You step quick, and don&#39;t talk on the road.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t concern the weather, of course?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It concerns the people, Mr. Trevelle. I&#39;ll tell
you when the time comes. We are in London now,
I think. My address is the Savoy Hotel. Send me
yours there. To-night I&#39;m off to Hampstead to see
a little girl. She&#39;s just out of Ragusa, and it&#39;s to be
imagined what this means to her. The north is merciless
to the south in that respect. I&#39;m afraid of the
news I shall hear; more afraid than I can say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He fell to silence suddenly as the train crossed Cannon
Street bridge and the face of the river was disclosed.
A drizzle of snow had begun to fall again,
and many hummocks of block ice floated beneath the
bridges. Such a night had not been seen since Victoria
was Queen and Melbourne her Minister. They
entered the station to the raucous shouts of the newsboys,
crying the latest tidings of the frost.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">In the suburbs, there was little real understanding
of the momentous truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Kensington, Paddington, and Hampstead were
frozen out, but their young people enjoyed the predicament.
Weary water-men plugged the mains and
wondered if Christmas half-crowns would compensate
them for the trouble. Plumbers left footprints on the
silks of time and had become great personages. The
roads were like iron; the wood pavement impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
but for the sand which covered it. Even the meanest
wore some kind of shabby furs, while the well-to-do
were so many bundles of fine skins, from which rubicund
jowls peeped out.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber went to the Savoy Hotel and rested a few
hours in his room before going on to Hampstead.
There were a few of his own countrymen there and
they, oddly enough, spoke of a mild winter in Eastern
America and a general absence of severity throughout
the States. He learned with some surprise that his
meeting with the Emperor had been made known to
New York and was considered a triumph of a personal
kind&mdash;though it had given offence in some religious
circles and was supposed to be antagonistic to
the peace idea. He determined to confute this without
loss of time, holding, as he did, the firm faith that the
Kaiser was the one great instrument of peace in the
western world, and had the sanest ideas upon the subject.
For the first time in his life, there was a trouble
of the conscience concerning his own business and
the mission upon which it had sent him. Was he, in
truth, an obstacle to a gospel which had begun to
obsess the minds of the Anglo-Saxon race? He knew
that the charge was false and his pride resented it
warmly. He desired peace absolutely&mdash;what forbade
him to prepare the nations for war?</p>

<p class="indent">It was growing dark when he set out for Hampstead,
and there were many lights in the little house in
Well Walk when he arrived there. A very ancient
parlourmaid, who would have served Rembrandt for
&quot;a head,&quot; opened the door and told him that Mr. Silvester
was at home. She added also that she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
supposed he was the doctor, and plainly conveyed her
disappointment that he was not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; he said, &quot;the young lady is no better, then?
Well, I&#39;m sorry for that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, and ye may be, sir. We think it&#39;s new-monica.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shook the powdered snow from his boots and
went into the hall. Gabrielle, hearing footsteps, ran
out on the landing above and looked over the banister.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that you, Mr. Faber&mdash;how good of you&mdash;how
glad she will be!&quot;&mdash;and saying all this in a breath,
she came down the stairs and held out her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So, there&#39;s no great danger after all,&quot; he rejoined.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked surprised. &quot;Why no danger?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you come to me smiling. Well, I&#39;m anxious,
anyway. Shall I be able to see her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, you will. She is asking for you always.
Please come right up at once. Oh! there I am, speaking
your language&mdash;how ridiculous it must sound to
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess it makes me feel at home. Is this the room&mdash;will
she be ready, do you think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She heard you at once. She has been counting the
hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her soft fingers knocked twice and they went in.
The room was small, but it had been furnished with
a great elegance. He was glad to see some beautiful
white flowers on a little table by the bedside, and a
basket of fine grapes with them. The note of it all
was pure white, with rich red curtains and pictures
in gilt frames. The bed had dimity hangings with
great red roses for a pattern. A fire of logs roared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
up the chimney and a thermometer was hung upon
the wall by the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo! Maryska, my dear!&quot; he said, going to the
bed and pressing her thin fingers with his own. He
thought her terribly changed: the black eyes shone
as those of a famished animal; the face was very
white; the breathing laboured; the hands hot to the
touch. But she smiled at him nevertheless and tried
to sit up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got the marsh fever,&quot; she said, as though
satisfied by her own diagnosis, &quot;it&#39;s your ship that
did it. Why did you leave me in this damnable country
when I was ill? Don&#39;t you hate it as much as
my father did? Oh! I think you must, you really
must.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was a little taken aback, and sat at the bedside
before he answered her. Gabrielle nodded as who
should say, &quot;Now, you would like to talk to each
other.&quot; Then she slipped away, and closed the door
softly. The crackling of the logs and the ticking of
the clock were loud sounds in the cheery room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why!&quot; he exclaimed at last, &quot;you surprise me,
Maryska. I thought your father liked England?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head almost fiercely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d tell you what <i>he</i> said if she would let me!
She says it&#39;s wrong. Why should it be, when my
father said it? He called England&mdash;but there, it hurts
me, boss. Oh! it hurts me so much!&quot;&mdash;and with that
she flung herself back on the pillow, warm tears of
the memory in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">He perceived that she had no business to be talking,
and for some time he sat there, holding her hand and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
watching her. What a child she was, and with what
justice had she called him from the platform of her
age, an &quot;old, old man.&quot; The tragic irony of his attempt
to bring happiness into the life of the man who
had befriended him struck him anew and would not be
silenced. How little money could achieve when destiny
opposed! He reflected that brains were the
greater instrument and fell to wondering if brains
had helped him in his dealings with Maryska.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Feeling any better, my dear?&quot; he asked her by
and by. She turned upon her side and looked at him
with eyes pathetically round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should be all right if I could get away from
England, Mr. Faber. Do you think that you can take
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, I&#39;ll take you, Maryska. Where would
you like to go to, my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thought upon it, biting the sheet with fine
white teeth. Her white cheeks flushed with the effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would like to live in a city where there are many
lights&mdash;in Paris, I think. <i>He</i> liked Paris. He said
it was a bit of a hell, and he liked it. I told the wolf
man with the whiskers that, and he said, &#39;Oh, hush,
hush!&#39; Why did he say that, Mr. Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because, my dear, he&#39;s a clergyman, and your
father was what we call a Bohemian. They don&#39;t say
such words amongst our people. You mustn&#39;t be offended
with them, Maryska; you must try to do what
Gabrielle tells you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up, her suspicion on an edge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going to marry Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, how can you ask me that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
&quot;Because I think that you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What would she want with &#39;an old, old man&#39; like
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska reasoned it out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not so old when you are with her. Besides,
I am getting used to you. It is your looks which
I don&#39;t like. You are not really so old, are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not forty yet, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how old is Harry Lassett?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was a surprising question, and he turned sharply
when he heard it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you know that Harry Lassett is going to
marry Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She bit her lips and half sat up in bed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe that. They say so, but it&#39;s wrong.
You can&#39;t make any mistake in those things. <i>He</i>
used to beat me when I asked him; he wouldn&#39;t let
me talk about it, but I know. It&#39;s something which
changes your life. It is not that awful thing I saw
in the streets of Ranovica. God Almighty! none of
those girls will ever have a lover now, will they, Mr.
Faber?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The child&#39;s eyes were staring into vacancy as though
she saw a vision beyond all words terrifying. Here
in this silent house remote from London&#39;s heart, the
unnameable hours of war were lived again both by
the man and the girl. John Faber&#39;s soul shivered at
the hidden meaning of these words of woe. Had not
his act carried Louis de Paleologue&#39;s daughter to the
hills? Was he not responsible for what had been?
And he was a servant of such a nation&#39;s instruments&mdash;a
servant of war in its lesser aspect as in its greater.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
He did not dare to look the truth in the face. The
judgment of God seemed to be here.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We won&#39;t speak of the things which are dead,
Maryska,&quot; he said at length. &quot;The men you name
are like the beasts; it is well to leave them in their
kennels. Your life begins again with me. I&#39;ll take
you to Paris directly you are able to bear the journey.
Can I say more?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you, Mr. Faber? I could bear the journey
any time&mdash;now, this minute, if you would take me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear child, you are not fit to go. We must
nurse you many days yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s what the doctor says. <i>He</i> never liked
doctors. They were all&mdash;yes, knaves, he said, and the
other word which Mr. Silvester hates. Why should
I be kept here for these men?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because this time they are right, my dear. It&#39;s
too cold for anyone to go out of doors. What&#39;s more,
the sailors are on strike, and so we couldn&#39;t go if we
wished. You&#39;ll be well when the thaw comes, and
then I&#39;ll take you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will Harry Lassett come too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It troubled him to hear the reiteration of this idea.
The anxiety with which she regarded him, her eyes
so big and round, her breathing so laboured, her cheeks
so flushed&mdash;this anxiety added not a little to his own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you bring that young gentleman into it?&quot;
he asked her. &quot;How can he go with us? Hasn&#39;t
he got his duties to do here, my dear? What would
Gabrielle say if she heard it? Wouldn&#39;t she be put
out, don&#39;t you think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The round, dark face assumed an air almost of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
cunning. It was evident that she knew just what
Gabrielle would say, but was unmoved nevertheless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does &#39;engaged&#39; mean in England? When
<i>he</i> and I were in Paris, a lot of them came to the
studio. They would be engaged for a little while,
and then there would be others. Jeannette Arrn had
three lovers while I was there&mdash;Henri Courtans was
the last. Was she engaged to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was very earnestly put, and it embarrassed him.
What a life the child had lived; what an education
had been hers! And now he feared that the inevitable
had come to be. Thrown into the society of the big-limbed
boy, she had immediately fallen in love with
him. This should have been looked for, and it would
have been if he had realised a little earlier the nature
of her birthright and its consequences. She was born
in a land where passion is often uncurbed and the blood
runs hot in the veins. Religion had done nothing for
her; those who would educate her must begin at the
very beginning. He himself felt totally unfit for the
task. And she had refused already to live with the
Silvesters, at any rate in England.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has Harry Lassett spoken to you about going
to Paris?&quot; he asked upon an impulse. She shook her
head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish he would. I wish he would ask me to go
away from her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you think it would be very unkind to Gabrielle
to go with him even if there were no other
reason?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think that. She wouldn&#39;t care.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is going to be his wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
&quot;Yes, and that is why I hate her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No further question could be asked or answered,
for Gabrielle entered the room at the moment, and
immediately the child hid herself in the bedclothes
and would not speak another word.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span></p>

<h2><a name="ch3-2" id="ch3-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">OF LOVE BUT NOT OF MARRIAGE</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll stay to dinner?&quot; she asked, as they went
down to the drawing-room together a little later on.
It was very warm and snug there, and the deep red
shades upon the lamps appeared to him particularly
English. They had few such suggestions of home in
his country.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; he rejoined, &quot;if it will not be putting you
out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have some pea soup and a sole. My father
is Popish enough to eat little meat, but that is for
his stomach&#39;s sake&mdash;as Timothy was to drink wine.
Of course, the baby cannot eat anything at all. Did
you think very badly of her, I wonder? Is she really
as ill as the doctors make out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me how ill the doctors make her out, and
I&#39;ll say what I think. Anyway, it isn&#39;t pneumonia yet.
I&#39;ve seen too much of it to be scared by that particular
spook. She&#39;s a bit of congestion of the lungs, and
she&#39;s worrying herself into a fever. The rest&#39;s doctor&#39;s
talk&mdash;what they take a fee to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled, and went on busying herself about the
room. The fire light showed all her height and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
fine contour of well-developed limbs. Every movement
was full of grace, he said. Gabrielle Silvester
could have taken her place in any society in Europe.
For an instant, he thought of her as the bejewelled
hostess of a Fifth Avenue mansion, and that thought
returned later on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is good to hear you,&quot; she said with a light
laugh. &quot;Everyone who comes to a sick house seems
to think it necessary to speak in a morbid whisper.
They expect to look sorrow in the face on the doorstep.
Of course, she has been very ill&mdash;dangerously
ill, I think. Our bringing her to England was a very
great mistake; even father knows that now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then she isn&#39;t very happy here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very far from it. Did she say anything of it to
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, yes; she asked me to take her away by the
next train.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought she would; was it back to Italy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; to Paris&mdash;and what&#39;s more, she wants Harry
Lassett to be of the party.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He thought it necessary to tell her this: he had
debated it while sitting there and watching her graceful
movements about the room. His own act had
committed Maryska to her charge; his own words
must warn her of a possible danger. Upon her part,
however, the whole thing was treated without concern,
merely as the odd whim of a capricious child who
was sick. She surprised him very much by her attitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Harry amuses her,&quot; she said without turning, &quot;he
can be so atrociously vulgar. An accomplishment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
is it not, when it brings a little sunshine? They have
been the best of friends, and he comes here every day
with some present or other for her. It is all quite
pretty, and I am very grateful to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you would approve of his coming on my
yacht?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he could go, yes; but I know that it is quite
impossible. He has developed a surprising interest in
his business; he is in town every day. It&#39;s really most
wonderful!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I ask what his business is, by the way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked a little pained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He gets money from the people who sell stocks
and shares&mdash;the jobbers, don&#39;t you call them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the name, to be sure. So he goes down
to the city to watch them making money for him. It&#39;s
a joyous employment, sure; it won&#39;t make him bald!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle did not like the tone of this at all, she
bridled instantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare say that Mr. Lassett is very well content
with it. Don&#39;t you think that we might be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, certainly, I do. That&#39;s just what was in
my thoughts just now. If he&#39;s so well occupied in
London, he won&#39;t mind your taking a little holiday
with me&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With you! How odd it sounds!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Odd, or even; I mean every word of it. Will
you come to Florida on the <i>Savannah</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She hesitated and flushed. There are some tones
of a man&#39;s voice a woman never mistakes. Let him
lie to her, and she may be wholly convinced; deceive
her by vain promises, and she will believe him&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
let him touch the tonic of a lover&#39;s chord, and her
instinct is immediately attuned. Gabrielle knew that
John Faber was about to make love to her. It came
as a bolt from the blue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should I go to Florida in your yacht? Do
you propose to take Maryska there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do indeed&mdash;and you also!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As her nurse, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, as my wife!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He bent forward and watched her closely. She
had been standing by the piano, the aureole of the
lamp about her flaxen hair, making pure gold of its
silken threads. For an instant she trembled as though
some strange chord of her nature had been touched.
Then, very slowly, she crossed the room and sat in
the chair upon the other side of the fireplace. A warm
light played upon her young face now; she was, indeed,
a beautiful woman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you ask me to be your wife when you
know I am engaged to Harry Lassett?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I believe it is necessary to your happiness
and mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just a guess at reasons then. If I believed it,
I would say it is a want of compliment to me. But I
don&#39;t believe it. You are masterful and would brush
aside all obstacles. If I were not a woman with some
faith in things, you would do so. I happen to be that&mdash;perhaps
to my sorrow. No, indeed, I could never
be your wife while I believe in the reality of my own
life, and the good of what I work for. You must
know how very far apart we are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In what are we apart? In causes which politicians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
quarrel upon. I guess that&#39;s no reason. Does a man
love a woman the less because she believes the earth
is flat? If he&#39;s a fool&mdash;yes. A wise man says, she is
only a woman, and loves her the more. Gabrielle, I
don&#39;t care a cent for your opinions, but I want you
very badly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed heavily, and raised herself in her chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My opinions are my life,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I
have built a temple to them in my dreams. How it
would come crashing down if I married you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll build it, anyway&mdash;it&#39;s a promise. You shall
have your temple if it costs half a million. They won&#39;t
miss me there if I find the money. I shall be proud
enough of my wife the day it is opened!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Caring nothing that she could only speak of
money. Oh, don&#39;t pursue it; don&#39;t, don&#39;t! All my
years have been a schooling against such things as
are dear to you. There are a hundred interests in my
life I have never dared even to mention to you. This
home, my father&#39;s work&mdash;do they not say &#39;no&#39; for me?
I should be a burden to you every day; you would
have nothing but contempt for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If a man were fool enough to base his unhappiness
on his wife&#39;s goodness&mdash;why, yes. Don&#39;t you see that
I may admire all this, and yet differ altogether?
Isn&#39;t it one of the reasons why I ask you to be my
wife, that I know how much reality and honest faith
lies behind all you do? You haven&#39;t considered that&mdash;you&#39;ll
have to before it&#39;s done with. I&#39;ve a habit of
getting my way; you&#39;ll discover it before I am
through!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The taunt turned her patience to defiance.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
&quot;No,&quot; she said, standing up as if impatient of it
all, &quot;I shall discover nothing, Mr. Faber. I intend
to marry Harry Lassett in February!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! then I&#39;ll have to begin upon that temple at
once. Have you thought about the plans of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not spoil my dreams&mdash;there is the bell. I
think it must be Harry, for my father has a key.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She went toward the door, he watching every step
she took. Was it the face of a woman going to meet
her lover, the face of an ecstasy, or of a painter&#39;s
dream? The prosaic man deemed it to be neither.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet he believed that she would marry the boy.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle believed that also, but it was a vague
thought, floating amid a medley of reproaches and
vain longings.</p>

<p class="indent">She had gone to her bedroom at eleven o&#39;clock,
when the night-nurse came on duty, and the quiet
house was hushed to sleep; and there she sat before
a great fire listening to the footsteps of the skaters who
passed by, or the chime of bells upon the still air.</p>

<p class="indent">What momentous thing was this which had happened
to her to-day&mdash;what flood of fortune which had
swept by and left her to a woman&#39;s reckoning? Was
it not the thing which she had conceived in dreams
most sweet&mdash;the hope which her father had not been
ashamed to utter, the golden shore to which her eyes
had been turned in hours of vain imagining? In a
twinkling the gates of great promise had been opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
for her, and she had refused to enter in. A word, and
all the power and place of money would have been at
her command. She had been silent&mdash;the coach of
opportunity had rolled by and left her alone.</p>

<p class="indent">She would have been less than a woman if some
blunt truths had not emerged from this labyrinth of
changing ideas. It is true that Faber had offered to
make her Maryska&#39;s guardian, an obligation she was
to share with her father to their mutual benefit. No
money was to have been spared. They were to take
a great house in London, and furnish it regardless
of cost. The gates of that narrow social enclosure
which money can open were no longer to be barred to
them. Luxury of every kind was to be at their command&mdash;but
all as recipients of a comparative stranger&#39;s
benevolence, and as the servant of his whims. It
would be different as his wife, for these things would
have come to her then as a right.</p>

<p class="indent">She was but a minister&#39;s daughter, but these are
democratic days, when money builds altars whereat
even the ancient houses worship. Men are made peers
because they have so much money to put on the political
counter, or were famous as makers of jam and
vendors of good provisions. All sorts of vulgar personages
crowd the royal precincts and wear a William
the Conqueror air, most ridiculous to see. The
old titles of birth and breeding are hardly recognised;
unrecognised absolutely where women are concerned.
Gabrielle looked at herself in the glass, and knew that
she would have gone far in this latter-day hurly-burly
they call society. She had all the gifts, youth, beauty,
wit; she was found sympathetic by men and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
were her slaves whenever she appeared among them.
She could have built a social temple, and there would
have been many worshippers.</p>

<p class="indent">And for what had all this been put aside? For the
love of a man, or for the trick of an imagined sentiment?
Harry Lassett made a purely physical appeal,
but she was hardly aware of the fact. Faber had said
that she was drifting into the marriage, and this idea
occurred to her when she sat alone in the silence of
the night. The years had conspired to bring this impasse,
from which there was no escape but by marriage.
She believed that the opportunities of the day
would not recur, or if they did recur, that she must
give the same answer.</p>

<p class="indent">He would build her temple and lay the first stone,
perhaps upon the day she became Harry Lassett&#39;s wife.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">John Faber himself had thought very little of this
wonderful building when she had first mentioned it
to him; but the idea began to obsess his mind as he
returned to his hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">To say that he was greatly impressed by Gabrielle&#39;s
refusal of his offer is to express his feelings upon that
matter somewhat crudely. There are women&#39;s moods
which hurt a man&#39;s pride, but heal it as quickly. His
early astonishment gave place anon to a warm admiration
for her principles. They must be something more
than mere professions, after all, and were so real that
she had refused one of the biggest fortunes in the
world because of them. This of itself was a considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
fact which dwelt in his mind. He had discovered
few great characters in the course of his busy life,
and was tempted to believe that Gabrielle Silvester
was one of them.</p>

<p class="indent">Her passion for Harry Lassett, if it existed, was a
more difficult matter. The man of forty, who has
never married, is prone to some sentimentality where
calf love is concerned. Well as he may disguise it
from the world, there is a bias towards a lover&#39;s Arcady;
a tenderness for the secret groves which he
will never confess. The mere man goes out to the
witching hour of the young life. He has mad moments
when he rages against his lost youth, and would
regain it, even at the cost of his fortune. One such
moment Faber himself had known when he went out
with Maryska to the hills. It would never recur; he
had mastered it wholly even before they returned to
Ragusa; but he could credit Gabrielle with a similar
weakness, and wonder how far it would wreck her
story. Let her marry Harry Lassett, and the first
chapters of a pitiful tragedy surely were written. He
was quite certain of that.</p>

<p class="indent">With this was some new estimate of his own position.
He could be no hero in the eyes of such a
woman. From that standpoint his appeal to her must
be quite hopeless. There had been nothing of the dashing
cavalier in his record, nothing but the mere
amassing of money; no glamour, no public applause.
Women like all that and forget much else when it
is there. He had not done the &quot;great good thing&quot;
which Maryska, the untutored child, had promised him
he might do. Was it too late even yet? This temple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
he would build at Gabrielle&#39;s bidding, must it stand
as the perpetual witness to the futility of his own attainments?</p>

<p class="indent">And so, finally, and merging into the one great
thought was his own awakening love for a beautiful
woman. He no longer doubted this. Admiration was
becoming a passion of desire, which might lead him to
strange ends. He saw her as she sat by the fireside,
the warm light upon her eloquent face&mdash;he heard her
sympathetic voice, watched the play of gesture, the
changing but ever-winning expression. He would
have given her every penny he had in the world that
night to have called her his wife. It came to him as
an obsession that he could not live without her.</p>

<p class="indent">For thus do men of forty love, and in such a passion
do the years often mock them!</p>

<h2><a name="ch3-3" id="ch3-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">AFTER TEN DAYS</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie Morris was a man who rarely knocked upon
any doors, and certainly, had he stooped to such a
weakness, it would not have been upon the door of
his very democratic patron, John Faber, who was
never surprised to see him whatever the hour or the
place.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it&#39;s you, my boy! I thought no one else would
butt in at this time in the morning. Well, and what
brings you now? I thought you were in Portugal!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie Morris, who smoked a cigarette which had
the obliging quality of rarely being alight, sat down
by his friend&#39;s bedside and thrust his felt hat still
farther upon the back of his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guess I came over last night&mdash;the hotel clerk
said you were visiting. Say, I must have a talk with
you. Benjamin has cabled Paris for the news, and
he&#39;s got to have it. You know Benjamin, sure! Well,
then, you know what you&#39;ve got to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber knew Benjamin Barnett of the <i>New York
Mitre</i> very well, but the process of &quot;doing it&quot; seemed
to amuse him. He sat up in bed and called for his
man, Frank, who had been brushing his clothes in
the bathroom.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
&quot;What time is it, Frank?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A quarter past nine, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then go and order half a dozen Bass&#39;s ale for
Mr. Morris, and bring me my coffee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The journalist offered no objection whatever to this
drastic prescription, and when the beer was brought,
and coffee, with hot-house grapes and other fine fruit,
had been set at the bedside, he drained a glass to the
dregs and then spoke up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Benjamin says the strike on their side is going
to keep wheat out of England for a month. You&#39;re
the man most concerned in that, for a word from
you could end it. It&#39;s because your Charleston people
went out that the others followed. What I&#39;m thinking
is that you&#39;re hoist with your own petard. You must
tell me if it&#39;s true or false?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber was out of bed by this time, dressed in a
wonderful Japanese kimono which gave him the appearance
of a theatrical mandarin. He was always
amused by Bertie Morris, and generally ready to help
him. Now, however, he seemed at a loss, and he
walked to the window and looked out before he gave
him any answer whatsoever.</p>

<p class="indent">What an unfamiliar spectacle he beheld from these
high windows of the Savoy Hotel! The River gave
promise of soon being frozen from bank to bank.
Great lumps of shining ice protruded from its black
face, and thousands of idlers were ready to play in
the arena this memorable winter would create for
them. Far away, to Westminster and beyond, the
scene suffered no change, the river of ice flashed in
the wan sunlight of the bitter day. He had heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
yesterday of a pageant the city would prepare, and
here this morning were the outposts; jovial men who
waited to prepare the theatre, hew down the hummocks,
and make many a broken path straight. An
ox would be roasted whole upon the Thames to-morrow,
and many a keg of good beer broached. The
citizens themselves watched the strange scene from the
banks and the bridges, thousands of them in black
lines&mdash;well-to-do and ill-to-do; men and women about
whose glowing bodies fortune had put fair furs;
wretched out-of-works who shivered in the cold and
had hardly a rag to cover them. Stress of weather
could break many a barrier; there would be little caste
in England when a few weeks had run.</p>

<p class="indent">Faber regarded the scene for a little while in silence;
then he took up the conversation at the exact point
where Morris had left it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does Benjamin name me in this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be sure he does; you&#39;re the marrow of it. What&#39;s
Faber going to do with the wheat he&#39;s cornered?
That&#39;s what he asks. I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ll tell him,
and so I ask also. What are you doing in corn?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m buying it, Bertie. I began about a month ago
when the weather first did stunts. Of course, you
don&#39;t say that. For Benjamin the news is that I happen
to hold a number of steamers at Liverpool and in
the Thames, and that the men on strike there won&#39;t
unload them. Say I&#39;m a d&mdash;&mdash;d unlucky man, and
leave it there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll do that, sure. The British public won&#39;t,
though. Guess you&#39;re out for a big scoop this time,
John. I&#39;m d&mdash;&mdash;d if you&#39;re not the quickest flier I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
ever saw at any game you like. Selling it, I suppose
to the philanthropic agencies? Is that the line? They
pay a hundred per cent. to feed the hungry, and you
look on and bless &#39;em! What a story for Benjamin!
How he would put the ginger in!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dare say he would. I know Benjamin. The philanthropic
agency business is in his line. He met
Miss Silvester, I think, when she was over. Does he
know that she&#39;s at the head of this good Samaritan
flare? Has he heard of the national committee with
her name among the four hundred? I&#39;d say something
about that if I were you; it&#39;s the &#39;homes of the
people&#39; lay, and goes down every time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think&mdash;a committee for feeding the people
and a minister&#39;s daughter at the head of it. Shall I
tell &#39;em they must buy the corn from you in the end
at a forty per cent. rise? By gosh! that laugh would
be on time, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, it would, certainly. But you may leave
my name out there. Say I take a serious view of the
situation, and if the frost holds, I look for something
like a panic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you don&#39;t think the government can feed
them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have no doubt about it whatever. If you&#39;ll come
with me by and by, I&#39;ll show you such scenes in London
as you may not see again if you lived the lives
of your great-great-grandchildren. It&#39;s war and no
war. When some fool gets up and cries that the
Germans are sailing from Kiel you&#39;ll have pandemonium.
There&#39;s sure to be one before the week is out.
I open my papers every morning and expect to read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
the news. I tell you we are going to see something and
see it quick. Let Benjamin understand that. I don&#39;t
suppose you&#39;ll forget to point out to him the advantage
of having such a brilliant man upon the spot.
You won&#39;t be backward in coming forward, my boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bertie assumed a meek look which served him very
well upon these critical occasions when he interviewed
a great personage for the purpose of taking away his
character. A pleasant &quot;I don&#39;t think&quot; was his only
comment upon the impertinence of the observation;
but for the rest even his conventional imagination was
impressed. John Faber was not the man to be wasting
his time upon mere speculations. When he indulged
in the luxury of a guess, a fortune usually lay
at the back of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you meaning to say that there is any real
danger of this same invasion?&quot; he asked rather timidly.
&quot;Benjamin would like to hear you about that;
you&#39;re the first man he&#39;d send to if he thought the
game was on. Do you think it yourself, now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think nothing of the kind. The Germans are
not madmen. They&#39;ve got the sanest man in Europe
at their head, and he is not likely to do stunts with
the Gulf Stream holding the stakes. What the Britisher
has got to fear is the consequence of war without
its actuality. He&#39;s had that to fear any time these
ten years. Now that wheat is cornered, and the shipping
trade has fallen foul of the sailors, there is a
flesh and blood bogey behind it. By gosh! he&#39;s frightened.
I know it, and so do the newspapers. The
Cabinet met last night and the King sent for Kitchener
afterwards. They know there where the shoe pinches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
and they see other bogeys. Let this frost hold, let
hunger get a grip on the people over yonder, and there
isn&#39;t an institution in Great Britain which will last a
week. You can tell Benjamin as much, though there&#39;s
no need to say I said it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had become unusually serious, pacing the room
while he talked, and often looking out at the frozen
river. Shrewd interviewer that Morris was and blessed
with an excellent memory, nevertheless these things
were big enough to be made a note of on the spot,
and he took paper and pen for the purpose. That
was the moment, however, when a servant came in
to announce Mr. Rupert Trevelle, and immediately
afterwards Faber fell to earnest talk with this famous
diplomatist who was Sir Jules&#39;s right hand. There
was nothing left for the journalist to do but to drink
up the beer&mdash;a task he performed with alacrity.</p>

<p class="indent">To be sure, his curiosity was provoked not a little
by the vivacity of the talk to which he listened, and
when a little later on Faber apologised for taking his
guest into the adjoining room to discuss some private
business, the journalist prevailed against the man, and
stooped without hesitation to the methods of Mary
Jane. Bertie&#39;s ear fitted the keyhole very well, and
he did not mind the draught overmuch. What he
heard seemed to interest him very much. And the
greater merit of it was that it had not been told him
in confidence.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">The three men left the hotel in a private car some
hour and a half later, and told the driver to go past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
Aldgate to Commercial Road East. They all wore
heavy fur coats and were put in good spirits by the
vigour of the day and the stillness of the frosty air.
London looked her best that morning. The whiteness
of her roofs, the iron hardness of her roads, blue sky
above and a kindly sunshine to make a rare spectacle
of the gathered snow&mdash;never had she worn a fairer
aspect. Even the Americans felt at home and needed
but a blizzard to deceive them utterly.</p>

<p class="indent">The cheerful aspect of London chiefly impressed
the imagination of the people in the West End at this
time and they had got little beyond it at this stage.
They talked in the clubs of the newspaper canards
and pooh-poohed them. It was true that the rivers
were frozen, but it was ridiculous to suppose that the
severity of the frost would endure. As to the food-supply,
what did it matter to men who could order a
sole √† la Victoria or a <i>tournedo</i> without causing the
club steward to lift an eyelid? The frost was phenomenal,
but it would in due course be followed by a
thaw. Meanwhile, those d&mdash;&mdash;d bakers were charging
a shilling a loaf, and making a fortune by other
people&#39;s necessities. It was a scandal with which any
but an incompetent Radical government would have
known how to deal.</p>

<p class="indent">Such a pleasant way of regarding things was universal
through the West End, where business went
on much as usual, and only the newspapers displayed
the vulgarity of agitation. It is true that the cold
caused a seeming bustle upon the pavements; but this
was merely the cold, and the old gentlemen, who trotted
vigorously where yesterday they walked, were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
driven to such antics by the bakers, but by the bitterness
of the weather. Not until the car had carried
the three men past Aldgate Station to the junction of
the Commercial Road, was there any evidence whatever
of that menacing spectre the wise men had
dreaded. Then it came upon them without warning&mdash;a
procession of the social derelicts with a red flag
for their banner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, now!&mdash;and what do you call this?&quot; Faber
asked, as the car came to a standstill and the mob
pressed about it. &quot;Is this a dime show, and do we
get you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle, a little shaken by the attentions of his
neighbours, who had climbed upon the footboard to
look at him, declared that they were the &quot;out-of-works.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just one of the usual January processions&mdash;I expect
we shall see a good many before we are through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess they look ugly, anyway&mdash;see that fellow
with the lantern jaw and the club? It will want a
pretty big baker to stop him if he&#39;s hungry!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are stopping him by food&mdash;the government
must help us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And buy Faber&#39;s corn?&quot; chimed in Morris, &quot;he&#39;s
about two or three hundred cargoes to sell&mdash;at a price,&quot;
and he laughed as though it were the finest of jokes.
Trevelle, however, was too busy with his neighbour
on the footboard to say anything at all. A swarthy
ruffian with a ragged crimson tie had grabbed at his
watch and chain, and discovered a fifteen shilling
enamelled timepiece, which annoyed him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A &mdash;&mdash; fine gentleman, you are&mdash;I don&#39;t fink!&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
and he went off, rattling the money-box, which he had
dropped for the purpose of this assault.</p>

<p class="indent">It was an aggressive procession&mdash;long, disorganized,
revolting in aspect. Men of all ages had set out upon
the long march to Trafalgar Square, where they would
demand of the government work or bread. You may
see the same any winter; but this winter of surpassing
cold had given the wolf&#39;s jowl to many who were
pleasant-faced without it, and the fire of hunger shone
from many eyes. A few girls of brazen mien walked
by the ragged coats and occasionally danced a few
steps to keep themselves warm. With them went
grandfathers and grandsons; old men, whose backs
were bent by the labours of distant years; mere lads
looking for a row with the &quot;coppers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do those fellows think they will do?&quot; Faber
asked of Trevelle. He had seen the same kind of
thing in his own country&mdash;but there, as he put it, the
club of the policeman was more powerful than the
brotherhood of man. Trevelle admitted that it was
so. He had been three days in New York. Therefore,
he knew it must be so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If the frost holds, they will loot the shops. They&#39;ve
done it before with an embryo Cabinet Minister to lead
them. I tell my journalistic friends that they are
going to do a finer thing than they have ever done
before&mdash;they are going to help the mob to loot Bond
Street. We are on the top of a volcano; we have been
really, for twenty years. The wonder is that we have
never discovered it before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meaning to say that the volcano is now about
to take a hand in it! Well, Bertie here will be on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
the spot if there&#39;s any looting to be done. I guess
the side-track won&#39;t see much of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris was rather flattered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was up among the lakes one winter,&quot; he said,
&quot;and I saw the wolves pull down a buck. He came
out of the woods like a race-horse on the straight.
There were twenty snarling devils at his heels, and
they had eyes like live coals. Presently one jumped
at the buck&#39;s throat, and you could not have struck a
match before the others had fixed their teeth in him.
He bleated for about two minutes; then he was so
many gnawed bones on the ice. Well, that&#39;s what I
think of the social system sometimes. Let the cold
get a cinch on those particular wolves, and you&#39;ll
count some bones! It has got to be&mdash;hunger is going
to make it so!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No one contradicted him, for the scenes on the side-walk
were too engrossing. All Whitechapel appeared
to be abroad that day as though curiosity drove it
out of the mean houses. Wan women stood at their
doors seeking vainly for some tidings which should
be carried to the famished children within. Hulking
labourers took their leisure with their broad backs
supported by friendly posts. Paradoxical as the thing
seemed, the public-houses were beset by fierce mobs
of ruffians, both sexes being fairly represented in the
m√™l√©e. By here and there some anxious philanthropist
in a black coat moved amid the throngs, and spoke
words of good cheer to all. There were ministers of
religion whose faith knew nothing of new theology
but much of bread.</p>

<p class="indent">Through this press, by many a filthy street, the car
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
conveyed the strangers to their destination. This lay
some way down the Commercial Road and was officially
in Stepney. Long before they reached it, the
increasing throngs spoke of its whereabouts. A vast
mob of the hungry, the homeless, and the desperate
strove to reach a square-fronted building over whose
doors were written in golden letters the words &quot;The
Temple.&quot; A shabby structure of dull red brick, this
day it had become a house of salvation to the multitude.
And high above them, upon the topmost step
of a stairway which led to its unadorned halls, stood
Gabrielle Silvester speaking to the people.</p>

<p class="indent">She was dressed from head to foot in grey furs,
and her flaxen hair showed golden beneath the round
cap of silver-fox which crowned it. The excitement
of her task had brought a rich flood of colour to her
round girlish cheeks, and her eyes were wonderfully
bright. The nation&#39;s tragedy had dowered her with a
rare part, and finely she played it. All this publicity,
this movement, this notoriety of charity was life to
her. She worked with a method and an energy which
surprised even her most intimate friends. In Stepney
they had come to call her &quot;Princess Charming&quot;&mdash;a
title taken from their halfpenny stories and apt for
them. Whenever she drove, men doffed their caps,
while the eyes of the women filled with tears. This
very day she was feeding the people even as Christ,
her Master, had fed them. And, looking on with new
wonder and pleasure, was the man who knew that
she was necessary to him&mdash;she and none other.</p>

<p class="indent">The car came within a hundred yards of the Temple
and then was held up by the press. Faber called a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
sergeant of police, and slipped a sovereign into his
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get us up to the door and there&#39;s another,&quot; he
said, and immediately five sturdy policemen drove a
way through the hungry throngs with shoulders hardened
by such tasks. The car followed them slowly,
and as it went Faber threw silver among the people. It
was a mad act, for they fell upon it like wolves, and
when the police had quelled the riot, two of those who
had come to the Temple for bread lay stark dead upon
the pavement.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">There were two long counters running down the
centre of the Temple, and between them lay piles of
new crisp loaves. Many servers handed them out
to whoever asked for them, and continued so to do
until the day&#39;s supply was exhausted. It was a study
to watch the faces of those who came for relief&mdash;cunning
faces, pitiful faces, the faces of mean desire.
Some of these people would go out with their bread
and return immediately for more, trusting to the press
to remain undiscovered. Others were given to wild
words of thanks; but these were few, and in the main
it would seem that natural greed dominated other
thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle shook hands with Faber a little coldly;
her manner toward Trevelle was cordial; she hardly
noticed Bertie Morris. A habit of authority is easily
assumed by some women, and it sat upon her gracefully.
With unfailing dignity, she moved amid her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
assistants, directing, criticising, applauding them.
When the mere man ventured a word of suggestion,
he perceived very plainly that he was no hero in her
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; Faber remarked, &quot;have you nothing in
the ticket line? Do they all come in here on the nod?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Absolutely. Why should we have tickets?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;ve seen one old woman stow away five
loaves since I came in. Is that your idea of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, we can&#39;t stoop to trifles. And we have so
much to give away. Mr. Trevelle is so wonderful.
He has done a beautiful thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A good collector, eh? So he&#39;s doing it all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, and he is. It would not last a day without
him. We are coming to a time when the others
will have no bread to give away. He says that we
can go on for weeks and weeks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shouldn&#39;t wonder. Trevelle is a bit of a hustler,
anyway. I suppose you&#39;ve no time to tell me the
news?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shrugged her shoulders, almost impatient of
the mere cynic who could watch all this and say nothing
in its favour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is much better&mdash;of course, you are thinking
of Maryska? I don&#39;t think she wishes to go to Italy
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you will take that house we spoke of?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will talk to you about it when all this is over.
If you could only live a few weeks among these people!
And they say it is but the beginning. There will
be downright starvation soon. Thousands dying in
the very streets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
&quot;Just because God Almighty has sent an extra turn
of winter. Well, you are doing fine things, anyway.
This is better than the Temple we spoke of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why is it better?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because there are brains behind it. They are the
only things which count in the story of great causes&mdash;brains
and money. I put them in their proper
order.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; she exclaimed; &quot;of course you think of the
money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can I help it? What is feeding these people?
Bread! But you don&#39;t buy bread with a stone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There will be always money for those who really
suffer. I count upon Mr. Trevelle for all that. He
is a miracle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose he has begged of you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He brushed the question aside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trevelle knows me better. You don&#39;t come to rich
men unless you have a proposition. What are all these
people to me? I didn&#39;t starve them, anyway. Why
should I give them money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thought him quite brutal, and went away
presently to speak to some of &quot;her guests,&quot; who had
nearly fallen to blows on the far side of the hall. The
heaps of bread were vanishing at an alarming rate,
and the sea of faces beyond the doors of the building
declared its tragedies of want and hope. In many
a street in Stepney and Whitechapel that day the
bakers had no bread to sell. Men told you that the
government were at grips with the affair, but could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
any government compel men to work when they had
the mind to be idle? A panic of threatened starvation
drove the women to frenzy&mdash;the men to oaths.
There is always hope in the meanest house; but there
could be no hope if this frost endured and England
were paralysed by strikes. So they fought for the
gifts of the Temple, the strong triumphant, the weak
to the wall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guess you will have to lay on those tickets,&quot; Faber
said to her when next she came round to his side of
the room. She listened, now impressed by the reason
of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We could feed ten times the number,&quot; she said&mdash;&quot;it
is awful to turn them away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not take your Temple across the road? I
saw an empty factory as I came along; rent that, and
see that each man and woman comes but once a day.
Trevelle will do it for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She said that it must be done, and went away to
speak to the unwearying aide-de-camp about it. Later
on, with hardly another word to him, Faber saw her
enter a plain hired carriage and drive off through the
streets, followed by a howling mob whose moods were
twain: gratitude on the part of some, rage and disappointment
of others. She was going down to Leman
Street to the children&#39;s institute there, Trevelle
said; but he did not suggest that they should follow
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the lord Harry! you&#39;ve let me in for something!&quot;
he protested, mopping a perspiring face when
Gabrielle had gone. Faber replied that he would let
him in for a good deal more yet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
&quot;Anyway, you&#39;re a hero in her eyes,&quot; he said&mdash;and
as he said it, he reflected once more upon the meaning
of that quality to women, and how far he seemed,
from its possession where they were concerned.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="ch3-4" id="ch3-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">CINDERELLA</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">Gordon Silvester&#39;s mission to the East, as he would
call his work beyond Aldgate, was really a charity of
ten years&#39; standing, and one that often proved a thorn
in the flesh to Gabrielle, who, at heart, had no great
love for poor people.</p>

<p class="indent">When the memorable winter came, it was a natural
thing to use the resources of this mission for the purposes
of that undiscriminating charity the season required;
and so we had the Temple (suggested by
Rupert Trevelle and other organizations not less useful).
Silvester himself went into this work with the
ardour of a man of twenty. His sermons at Hampstead
were masterpieces of eloquence; his labours at
Stepney would have wearied a giant. The national
necessity demanded heroism&mdash;there will always be
many in England to answer such a call when it comes.</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle herself had been handicapped somewhat
by Maryska&#39;s illness; but the child responded quickly
to the devoted care bestowed upon her, and youth
emerged triumphant. Her every whim gratified, as
Faber dictated, she was nevertheless often alone in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
little house now, and many were the solitary hours
she spent there. Harry Lassett alone saved her from
despair; and so much did she come to rely upon him,
that she would send a note round by hook or by crook
whenever Gabrielle went out, and sometimes when she
was at home.</p>

<p class="indent">One of these letters went up the fifth morning after
Faber&#39;s visit to the Temple. Silvester was to address
a big meeting at the Mansion House upon that day,
and Gabrielle to open the factory as a second centre
for the distribution of bread. Maryska, who heard
with impatience all this talk of things she failed utterly
to understand, sulked for an hour in the lonely house,
and then dispatched a letter by a friendly butcher to
Harry&#39;s rooms, near the Holly Bush Inn. To her great
joy, he came at once, wrapped in a monstrous fur coat
and evidently amiable. This little waif from the unknown
was already growing into his life, though he
would have been angry had his oldest friend told him
as much.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, little Gipsy!&mdash;and what&#39;s up this morning?&quot;
he asked, as he came like a great bear into
Silvester&#39;s puny dining-room. &quot;Gipsy&quot; was his favourite
name for her, and she liked it well enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; she said, &quot;they&#39;ve all gone praying again,
Harry&mdash;they&#39;re not fed up with it, even yet! I&#39;m
sick of this house! Oh! I&#39;m d&mdash;&mdash;d sick of it, Harry.
Won&#39;t you take me out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He always laughed at this trick of strong expression,
caught by the child from a Bohemian father; an
anathema to Gabrielle and the Reverend Gordon.
Harry rather liked it, for it seemed to him somehow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
that he was talking to a man when he and Maryska
were alone together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Gipsy!&quot; he cried, taking both her hands,
&quot;you do look blue, upon my word! Where do you
want to go to now? Where shall I take you if we
have a spree?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thought upon it with a quick and serious glance
aside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To a caf√©!&quot; she said at length. &quot;Let us go and
eat bouillabaisse at a caf√©! <i>He</i> always did when the
drawing had tired him. Let us melt the old pot, and
drink it&mdash;that&#39;s what he used to say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Maryska! If I haven&#39;t got any money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed at that.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried, &quot;I&#39;ve got lots! Here&#39;s a whole
bank-note. Cannot we buy bouillabaisse with that,
Harry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Harry took the bank-note and perceived with astonishment
that it was for no less a sum than one hundred
pounds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guess Papa Faber gave you this, now, didn&#39;t he?
Generous old daddy, too. Have you seen him lately,
Gipsy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was a little troubled by his question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He came&mdash;it would be many days ago. He is
going to take me back to Italy. Why do you say he
is generous? Was he not <i>his</i> friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean your father&#39;s? Well, but we don&#39;t
always give a lot of money to the daughters of our
friends&mdash;not in this country, anyway! You ought to
think yourself very lucky, Maryska!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not understand that.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
&quot;He is very old,&quot; she said. &quot;Once I thought that
he looked at me as other men do&mdash;as you do sometimes,
Harry! It was when I first saw him at Ragusa.
Then it became different! He took us to Ranovica,
and I saw dreadful things. Jesus Christ, what things
I saw! Oh! if you had known&mdash;but I try to forget
them now. <i>He</i> would wish that&mdash;he never let me
speak of yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes were very wide open and shining; the
expressive face spoke of woe most piteous. And this
memory of suffering affected the boy also, destitute of
sentiment as he was in a general way. He stooped
suddenly and kissed her warm lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind, Gipsy dear! You&#39;ve got some jolly
good friends, and old Papa Faber will see you through.
I know he means to, for Gabrielle told me so. Just
think of it!; one of the richest men in the world your
godfather! Aren&#39;t you in luck?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled. Money, by hook or by crook, had been
Louis de Paleologue&#39;s gospel; how could she forget
it?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s in love with Gabrielle,&quot; she said, making no
shadow of a resistance to his kisses, but rather lifting
her lips to his, &quot;I know it, and so does she! Why
aren&#39;t you angry with them, Harry&mdash;don&#39;t you care?
Doesn&#39;t it make any difference to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; he said with just a touch of hardness in his
voice, &quot;I&#39;m not going to be jealous of an old bounder
like that. He&#39;s old enough to be her father. Let&#39;s
go and spend some of your money, Maryska. Does
the doctor say you may go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made a wry grimace.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
&quot;<i>He</i> used to say doctors were&mdash;&mdash;But no, I mustn&#39;t
tell you. I hate them! How can they know what&#39;s
inside us and why we feel it? Of course I shall go!
Why are you such a fool?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He gave way with a shrug, and she went up to get
her furs. It was a clear day with little wind and a
fine red sun. The frost had not broken, and these
two went down toward a city over which loomed the
menace of a peril terrible beyond imagination. But
of this the suburbs said nothing. Here and there a
baker would have a flaring bill in his window; there
were advertisements and appeals upon some of the
hoardings, but few stopped to read them. Such idlers
as gathered at the street corners had long exhausted
the only topic of conversation and smoked in silence
when they did not beg in companies. &quot;Bread, for the
love of God!&quot; was the chant of gangs of impostors
whose corduroys were no ornament to streets of red
brick. &#39;Buses, trams and taxis seemed quite unaware
of a crisis. The newspapers alone were hysterical.
They were covered with flaring black headlines.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry had engaged a taxi, and he took her for a
drive round Hyde Park before going on to the Savoy
Caf√© for luncheon. There were a few horsemen in the
Row, but they looked cold enough, and Maryska, who
had seen the Italian cavalry ride, thought but little
of their performance. For the most part, the big
houses in the West End were left to Jeames and his
humours. It would have been unfair to the owners
of these to say that panic had driven them away. They
were just wintering at Cannes or Monte or Aix as they
always did. Out there, the news from England seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
very dubious; it was almost impossible to believe that
such consequences had attended the severity of the
winter. Here in Western London, the intensity of the
cold, the relentless winds, the bitter weather taught
men to incline an ear to every rumour. Perhaps even
the sanest critic experienced a new sensation when he
stood apart and asked himself if it were true that the
sea might freeze from Calais to Dover. A menace of
an unknown peril troubled all; the East End alone
gave tongue to it.</p>

<p class="indent">They went down St. James&#39; Street and turned into
Pall Mall. Here their taxi was held up by a howling
mob, indulging in the ancient and amusing pastime
of breaking the windows of the clubs. Did a politician
as much as show a nose at a window-pane and a
shower of stones rewarded long years of salaried labour
or unfeed eloquence. Was he not one of those
who pocketed the profits the bakers were making?&mdash;and
if he did not, was he not, at any rate, &quot;capital in
a black coat&quot;; and where would you have a better
target? The hulking youths, who rattled their money-boxes
offensively in every face, cared much about beer
and little about bread, but that little had become rather
a grim reality these later days. They saw men, and,
women, too, dying, down East of absolute starvation&mdash;the
ghosts of the &quot;might be&quot; stood at their elbow and
whispered &quot;Better the jewellers&#39; shops than the mortuaries.&quot;
And to Bond Street they went, adding to their
numbers quickly and uttering bolder threats. &quot;Bread
or death!&quot; An odour of beer was the incense to this
prayer.</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska regarded these gangs of loafers with inquiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
eyes. She had seen nothing of the kind in any
country, and they excited her contempt. When she
asked Harry why none of them carried guns, his
laughter seemed to her quite silly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The police would never let them do that in Austria,&quot;
she said emphatically. &quot;Each side would have
guns and they would kill each other. The English are
afraid, I think. They should not let such people be in
London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Gipsy, don&#39;t you know this winter is killing
them by thousands? Haven&#39;t you read it in the newspapers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; she said. &quot;He would never believe what
was in the newspapers. He said it was&mdash;but you
would be angry. Are we going to have bouillabaisse
soon? I am dreadfully hungry; I could eat a man,
truly I could.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I mustn&#39;t take you where any man is. This
is the Strand, the place a lot of your people come to.
Do you see that sign over yonder? We are going
to eat there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Harry, it&#39;s a tailor shop! Oh, you little
beast! You would not take me to a tailor&#39;s shop? You
can&#39;t mean to take me there!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cheer up!&quot; he said, squeezing her arm, &quot;they cut
very well,&quot; and so they drove into the courtyard, and
seeing the actresses in weird furs at the door of the
caf√©, Maryska leaped down from the taxi and laughed
with pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could kiss you if it were English,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Evidently she was of the opinion that it was not
English, and so no more on that point was said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span></p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">Her idea was still a caf√© chantant, and the Savoy
met it badly.</p>

<p class="indent">She had seen a number of well-dressed women in
Berlin, in Madrid, and in Paris; but these, apparently,
had belonged to the undesirable classes, and she could
hardly believe that any showy creature in the neighbourhood
of the ancient hospice of the Fratres de
Monte Jovis&mdash;a fraternity unknown, may be, to the
courtly Gustave&mdash;could be of any other kidney.
Twenty times during the elegant repast must Harry
say, &quot;Do shut up, Gipsy!&quot; and as often must her eyes
express wonder. What had she done?</p>

<p class="indent">There were odd moments when the mere girl in
her came out with a bang, and the boy blushed up
to his ears. She laughed uproariously at two waiters
who cannoned each other off the soup, and when a
clumsy fellow dropped her box of chocolates on the
floor, she was after it in a twinkling and down on her
paws like a cat. This was a depressing interlude
which alarmed her conventional cavalier. Harry hated
&quot;scenes&quot; with the distaste habitual to the Englishman
of strait laced manners.</p>

<p class="indent">He forbade her to smoke, moreover, and that was a
grievance. She had smoked cigarettes since she could
remember anything at all, and were not other women,
especially the daughter-in-law of a personage famous
in great circles, were not they smoking? Maryska
knew nothing about palaces, but much about tobacco,
and this was a question which nearly led to the resignation
of the Cabinet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
&quot;I shall tell the waiter to bring me a cigar,&quot; she
exclaimed at last, resting her pretty face upon her
clasped hands and dealing him out a look which was
feline in its intensity. Harry gave up the contest at
that and ordered her a little box of Russian cigarettes
upon the spot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What would Mr. Silvester say?&quot; he asked her.
He might as well have talked of the weather.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t care a &mdash;&mdash;, and if you provoke me, I will
say it. Am I a little, little child that the priests shall
beat me? Give me a liqueur, and I will call you a
good boy. If you do not, I will go away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He did not wish her to go away, and he gave her the
liqueur. When, at length, he escaped, she besought
him to take her to &quot;the caf√© chantant,&quot; and for very
importunity they went over to the Coliseum. Here
both the <i>Connaisseuse</i> and the child were in evidence.
She called the echo of a tenor &quot;a beast,&quot; was dreadfully
bored by a comic sketch, but enraptured by the
&quot;plate-breakers.&quot; When a Russian <i>danseuse</i> appeared,
her eyes sparkled, and all her body swayed
to the rhythm of the graceful movements. She would
like to be a dancer&mdash;she said so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I leave the Silvesters, I will come to the
man who owns this theatre, and ask him to let me
dance. How much will he give me for that, Harry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was watching the Russian when she spoke, and
hardly noticed it&mdash;but she persisted, and would be
heard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I used to dance for <i>him</i>, sometimes&mdash;after we had
been to the caf√©s together. He played the fiddle&mdash;oh,
so badly!&mdash;and he said I was born to it. Why should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
I not dance when those Silvester people are tired of
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man said, &quot;Oh, rot!&quot;&mdash;but chancing to look
at her presently, he was startled to see the expression
upon her face, and the evidences of an ecstasy she
could not conceal. The music had entered into her
very soul. She bent to it; seemed to suffer a trance
because of it, while her eyes watched the scene as
though this were a house of visions. Harry Lassett
wondered; she was, indeed, an extraordinary child.
When the ballet was over, and they were in the cab
again, he told her so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about this dancing nonsense? Did you say
your father put it into your head?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I used to dance for him&mdash;very well, <i>he</i> said. I
would like to be that woman, Harry! The Russian
one, with the diamonds in her hair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be a fool, Maryska! She&#39;s been dancing
ever since she was four, I suppose. I expect she&#39;s got
a husband who drinks champagne and thrashes her
with a horse-whip. If you tried that game, they&#39;d
laugh at you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She leaned back upon the cushions of the cab, and
looked straight before her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No one laughs when I try to do things. I know
what I am saying. I could dance as well as the Russian
woman, and they would give me a lot of money.
Why should I not do it? I have no one who cares for
me! Mr. Faber is going to America&mdash;the Silvesters
do not like me because I am tired of praying. There,
I shall come to the theatre, and they will keep me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Harry was not a sentimentalist, very far from it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
but the restrained dolour of this confession made a
curious appeal to him, while, at the same time, the
childishness of it exasperated him. Was she not in
reality one of the most fortunate women in London
that day? Her failure to realise what John Faber&#39;s
friendship meant was incomprehensible, and yet it
could not be disputed that she did fail to realise it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, Maryska!&quot; he said emphatically, &quot;you
don&#39;t want me to be angry with you, do you, now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she said very quickly, &quot;not you, Harry.&quot; And
she laid her hand in his. He did not repulse her, but
went on with the argument.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you don&#39;t want me to be angry, talk sense!
Faber has adopted you, and he is one of the richest
men in the world. Very well, you&#39;ll never want for
anything on this planet. You&#39;re going into life on a
good pitch, and the bowling is bilge. I expect they&#39;ll
speak of you as a famous heiress presently, and half
the men in London be after you! What&#39;s the good
of romancing, then, or pretending you don&#39;t understand?
I&#39;m sure you understand just as well as I do&mdash;and
if it were me, I&#39;d knock up a century, certain!
Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re rather foolish, little Gipsy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head, and put her arms about him
in a gesture she could not control.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I am very lonely, Harry!&quot;&mdash;and
she spoke no other word until the cab drove up to the
house in Well Walk.</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">These excursions were no secrets between a boy and
a girl, and Maryska would recite every detail of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
upon her return to Hampstead. She was spared the
necessity upon this occasion by the appearance in the
road of another taxi, bringing Silvester and Gabrielle
from Stepney. The four met upon the pavement, and
immediately fell to a narrative of events. So much
had been done, Gabrielle said; it had been a day of
triumphs, and they had been achieved by Rupert
Trevelle in the face of great odds.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry looked at his fianc√©e while she was talking
of her success, and he could not but realise that the
recent days had changed her greatly. She had won
dignity, he thought, and a new outlook upon life,
which could not be a transient influence. There was
in her manner towards him a sense of superiority,
which the inferior intellect resented; while her good-natured
badinage upon his &quot;holiday&quot; suggested anew
his inability to play any serious part in the grave affairs
which now occupied her. But, beyond this, was
her utter indifference to his attempts to make her
jealous, and he knew that she hardly listened to him
when he spoke of Maryska and the theatre.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She wants to be a dancer! Oh! every child wants
to be that some time or other. Were you not going to
be an engine-driver yourself when you were seven?
You told me so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but she&#39;s a jolly lot more than seven, and if
you don&#39;t look out, she&#39;ll catch and bowl the three of
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Harry, that is nonsense. Are you going
skating to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, if you are coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t. Mr. Trevelle is going to dine with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
&quot;What! hasn&#39;t he done talking yet? Someone
ought to take away the key. That man is wound
up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At any rate, he is the life and soul of things. He&#39;s
got nearly twenty thousand pounds for us in five days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll have to borrow a monkey of him. Is your
tame millionaire coming also? They say in the papers
that he&#39;s been sent for by the Cabinet! Is he going
to sell some of his wheat cheap, or what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle froze perceptibly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have seen very little of Mr. Faber. It is not to
be supposed that he is interested in what we do. They
say he is going to America from Queenstown. All the
steamers are to sail from there next week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If the strike lets them! Is Maryska going with
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think so; we are to have charge of her.
Won&#39;t you come in, or must you go? I am perishing
here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; he said with chagrin, &quot;I must go, as usual&quot;&mdash;and
he lurched off down the street without even
offering his hand to her.</p>

<p class="indent">The truth was that he was angry both with himself
and with her. Brief as their odd engagement had
been, he knew that it had been a great mistake. He
felt vaguely that his brains were no match for hers,
and that she was coming to understand the fact. And
then there was his new attitude towards Maryska.
How strangely the child could influence him! He
remembered almost every word she had said since they
set out for the Savoy together. The memory of the
many <i>faux pas</i> she had made was so humorous that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
he stood upon the pavement to laugh at them again.
There followed a recollection of the moment when
she had put her arms about him, and he had kissed
her. His whole soul had gone out into that kiss! The
warm lips upon his own, the hands which thrilled him,
the hair brushing his face lightly&mdash;all had moved him
in a transport of desire he could not resist. And he
was engaged to Gabrielle! His step quickened when
he remembered it, and he tried to sweep the inevitable
accusation aside. He was engaged to Gabrielle, who
trusted him. A silent voice asked, was it cricket?&mdash;and
he could make no answer.</p>

<p class="indent">In his own rooms, by the Holly Bush Inn, the hag
who robbed him had stirred up a splendid fire in the
grate and set the teacups for two, a suggestion which
caused him some irritation. Here was his holy of
holies, chiefly devoted to cricket bats and tennis
rackets. The walls were decorated by a number of
&quot;groups&quot; of the teams for which he had played, including
two English elevens against Australia, and
at least six which had opposed the Players. Elsewhere,
and chiefly upon the writing table at which he
rarely wrote, were smaller pictures, including one of
Gabrielle which had been taken in New York, and another
which he called &quot;the Flapper&quot; portrait. The
latter showed a chubby-faced child of fourteen with
her hair down her back, and legs of such ample proportions
that she might have been in training as an
athlete. The picture had been his ideal for many
years, but he regarded it a little wistfully now. When
he sat down to tea, he took with him a little book between
whose leaves was a miniature of Maryska, done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
by her father some three years ago. Such an exquisite
painting had never been in his possession before.
It had been one of her few treasures, and yet
she had given it to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Louis de Paleologue had painted this in Paris, intending
to sell it; but Maryska stole it when he was
at the caf√© one day, and neither threats nor persuasion
had robbed her of it subsequently. It showed her
head and shoulders, a veil of gauze about her, and a
Turkish cap upon her head. The note of it was the
passionate intensity of the girl&#39;s eyes, glowing like
jewels in the picture, but with a depth of human feeling
art is rarely able to convey. For the rest it might
have been a miniature of the Bologna School and it
had all the virtues of colour of which those masters
were capable. Harry understood its value, and he
thought that he knew why Maryska had given it to
him. He did not ask himself why the gift had been
kept secret, or why he had no courage to speak of it
to Gabrielle.</p>

<p class="indent">He was at the stage when he knew that something
must be done, and yet would consent to drift upon the
tide of circumstances. The inevitable had happened,
and this boy and girl, thrown by the chance of confidence
into each other&#39;s society, were lovers already.
What the future had in store neither dared to ask.
Vanity and John Faber were driving him into a speedy
marriage with Gabrielle, and they had spoken already
of the week previous to Lent. This was to say that
in five weeks&#39; time he would be her husband. It
seemed impossible to contemplate. Harry drank his
tea with his eyes still upon the picture of Maryska.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span></p>

<h2><a name="ch3-5" id="ch3-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">THE MAN OF THE MOMENT</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">It was quite true that Faber had been summoned to
Downing Street; equally true to declare that not even
the wit of that engaging Paul Pry, Master Bertie
Morris, would have divined the nature of the interview.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps good common sense might have helped
him had he trusted to such a cicerone rather than to
his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">Here was the head of one of the most famous engineering
firms in the world held prisoner in London
during these days of national tribulation. The house
of John Faber and Son had achieved colossal undertakings
in all quarters of the globe. Its transport
mechanism was beyond question the finest in existence.
The genius of it was known to be the man who had
recently sold some millions of rifles to Germany&mdash;a
man accredited by rumour with such sagacity that he
had cornered the wheat-market during the earliest days
of this memorable winter. The latter proceeding did
not help his popularity in England, though it was ignored
by the politicians who invited him to Downing
Street. In a word, they desired to know how he was
going to bring his wheat into England.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
Faber was some hours at the conference, and directly
it was over he left London with Rupert Trevelle, and
set off for Liverpool. Unusually quiet and obviously
troubled by a &quot;brain fit,&quot; he delved into a mass of
newspapers while the train rolled on over the frozen
fields, and it was not until they had passed Crewe that
he laid the paper aside and addressed a remark to his
ready friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess London is pretty well like a rat pit just
now; at least these newspaper men make it so. Hunger&#39;s
a useful sort of dog when his dander is risen. I
suppose Miss Silvester has found that out already?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle, who smoked an immense cigar, and wore
a fur coat with a wonderful collar of astrachan, rose
to the occasion immediately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are living on a volcano,&quot; he said. &quot;The government
knows it, and others must guess it. I am
waiting every day to see the shell burst and the lava
come out. We want imagination to understand just
what is going on in England at the present time.
That is where we are short. All the way down here,
I have been looking at these cottages and asking myself
in how many of them the children have no bread
this night. My God! think of the women who are
bearing the burden&mdash;but, of course, you are the man
who has thought of it. I wonder sometimes how much
you would have made but for certain things. You
didn&#39;t buy corn to give it away in Stepney, Mr. Faber;
that wasn&#39;t in your mind a month ago. I&#39;ll swear you
had very different intentions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No need to swear at all. I&#39;m not a philanthropist;
I never was. I bought that wheat because the cleverest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
weather man in New York promised a winter which,
anyway, would make the market sure. I went in as
any other speculator. How I am coming out is a different
proposition. They don&#39;t seem to think much of
me in England&mdash;not by what these writers say. I
guess if I were a prize fighter, I&#39;d be doing better
business in the popularity line.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle was a little upset about it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It can all be put right in a day if you wish it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I don&#39;t wish it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know you don&#39;t; you are wanting the girl to
have the credit of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not? It&#39;s a bagatelle to me. And the game
will soon be up. I can feed a few thousands in London,
but I can&#39;t feed a nation. Either I send a cable
to Charleston surrendering to my men or I do not.
If I do, it will cost me half my fortune; if I don&#39;t and
this frost holds, you&#39;ll see red hell in England before
twenty days have run.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then the rumours about the strike breaking at
Liverpool are true? There is something in them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is everything in them. The government
can deal with this side if I deal with the other. It&#39;s
up to me in the end and I must say &#39;Yes,&#39; or &#39;No.&#39;
If I say &#39;Yes,&#39; all America will laugh at me&mdash;if I don&#39;t,
well who&#39;s to charge me? That&#39;s the situation, that
and your own people, who are going to give the politicians
their day. I tell you, it&#39;s a considerable proposition
and is going to make me older before I have done
with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was unusually earnest, and his manner forbade
any inquiry as to what had happened in Downing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
Street, a matter Trevelle&#39;s curiosity would have probed
if it could. To be candid, this polished gentleman,
who indirectly had brought the fact of Faber&#39;s presence
in England to the notice of the government, was
immensely pleased by the part he had played in the
stirring events of recent days. Not a lover of money,
but a persistent seeker after social credit, when it could
be gained by worthy ends, Trevelle had won distinction
in twenty ways: as a founder of boys&#39; camps, an
officer of Territorials, and a promoter of some schemes
which had become national. And here he was in these
critical days by the side of the man whose genius might
well be the salvation of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p class="indent">Then entered Liverpool a little late in the afternoon,
and went at once to the scene of the strike. It
was bitterly cold weather, but nothing to justify the
fearsome stories which had delighted London for some
days past. The strike itself appeared to be the result
as much of lack of work as of any fundamental discontent;
starvation had been busy here, and the fruits
of starvation were now to be reaped. As in London,
haggard gangs paraded the streets and clamoured for
bread; there were turbulent scenes in the darker quarters
of the city, and not a little of that unmeasured
mischief which ever treads upon the heels of want.
An interview with the men&#39;s leaders convinced Faber
that America alone could unlock the doors of this compulsory
idleness, and it set his own responsibility once
more in a lurid light. Let him cable that message of
surrender and the end would be at hand; but in that
case his own people would call him a genius no more
and Wall Street would deride him. He saw himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
as the enemy of the British people, dominant in victory
and yet upon the eve of a defeat which never
could be retrieved. And if this befell him a woman
must answer for it&mdash;an ancient story truly.</p>

<p class="indent">From Liverpool he journeyed to Fishguard, thence
to the south coast. A greater rigour of the frost was
here, and it was possible for the dreamer to understand
some of those fears which had haunted the
timorous during the eventful days. Perhaps a man
of large imagination might have been justified in
looking across the still seas and asking himself what
would befall the island kingdom if the prophets were
justified.</p>

<p class="indent">At Dover, even John Faber dreamed a dream and
did not hesitate to speak of it to Trevelle. Sleeping
lightly because of the bitter cold, he imagined that
the Channel had become but a lake of black ice in
which great ships were embedded, and that far and
wide over the unbroken surface went the sledges of
the adventurous. Driven to imitate the leaders in
this fair emprise, he himself embarked also upon an
ice-ship presently, and went out into the night over
that very silver streak which had been the salvation
of England during the centuries. The white cliffs behind
him disappeared anon in the mist; a great silence
fell all about; he passed an ice-yacht moving before
the lightest breeze, and she was but a shadow picture.
Ultima Thule and the frozen wastes were here.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a dream of the darkness, and it carried him
many miles from the English shore; he perceived that
the coastwise lights blazed out as usual, and he could
discern in the far distance the magnificent beams from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
Cape Grisnez and nearer to them the splendid message
of the Forelands. A phantom light upon his own ship
was powerful enough to cut a golden path over the
frozen sea and show him its wonders and its solitudes.
Here where great steamers went westward to the
Americas, eastward to the city&#39;s ports; here where
many thousands crossed daily at the bidding of many
interests; here a man might stand alone and hear no
other sounds than that of the freshening winds of
eventide or the groaning of the ice when the sea refuses
its harbourage. A weird, wild scene, stupendous
in its suggestion, an hour of Nature&#39;s transcendent
victory. And yet but a dream of his sleep, after all.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">Such was the vision which reality supported but ill.</p>

<p class="indent">There was ice in the southern harbours, but there
had been ice there before, and nothing but the imagination
of discerning journalists had bridged the peaceful
seas and put upon the frozen way the armies of the
invader. Faber perceived immediately that a few of
his ice-dredges from Charleston could undo any mischief
that Nature had done, and he sent a cable to
America there and then, as a sop to the fears of the
timorous rather than a measure of real necessity.</p>

<p class="indent">It was odd how, through it all, this man whose
name was known to so few Englishmen had become
the arbiter of the nation&#39;s destiny. He held the bulk
of the wheat which could be shipped from the West if
the men who loaded the ships were willing; with him
lay that &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; which should unlock the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
gates and bid a starving population enter the granaries.
Once in his younger days he had heard a preacher
who took for his text the words, &quot;Sell that thou
hast,&quot; and he remembered how that this man had declared
the need of an all-embracing sacrifice once in
the course of every life. The words haunted him, and
could not be stilled. He had become as a King or
Emperor of old time who could make war or end it by
a word. Irony reminded him that he was an apostle
of war, and that a sentiment which would deride it
had no place in his creed. Why, and for whom, should
he beggar himself to serve this people? His financial
empire would come down with a crash if he surrendered
now&mdash;he believed that he would never surrender,
and yet he sent a compromising cable to
America that day.</p>

<p class="indent">This was just before Trevelle and he returned to
London through a country which seemed to have no
other thoughts than the pleasures of the frost. Everywhere
the villages kept carnival upon the ice with
merriment and music and the pageantry of snows.</p>

<p class="indent">To Faber this seemed a wonderful trait in the national
character, and not to be met by Trevelle&#39;s cheery
reminiscence of the gladiatorial salute. These people
had not saluted the frost because they believed that
they were about to die, but because they thought that
the national intellect would enable them to live. It
had been the same during the Boer War and far back
during the Crimea. Beneath the veil of tribulation
lay the enduring faith that the nation would emerge,
purified by the ordeal and greater for the knowledge
of its own strength.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
&quot;You see yourselves worrying through, and that&#39;s
all you care about,&quot; he said, as the morning train
carried them to London, and the daily papers were
strewn about him like the monstrous leaves of an unhealthy
plant: &quot;the skin of this nation is the thickest
on the globe, and perhaps its most wonderful asset.
When you do get into a panic, you show it chiefly in
the smoking-room or over the dinner-table. This time
you&#39;ve the biggest chunk to chew I can remember, and
yet you are only beginning to see how big it is. The
mob is teaching you something, and you&#39;ll learn more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took up a journal from the seat, and passing it
over to Trevelle, indicated some immense headlines.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See, here! the crowd has burned down your Temple,
and is asking for another to keep &#39;em warm.
That&#39;s British right through, I guess, and something to
go on with. It&#39;s just what a man should expect when
he turns philanthropist on his own account. You give
them what they want, and they are mad because they
want it. It&#39;s a pretty story, and you should read it.
It will certainly interest you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle took up the paper and read the report to
the last line. Yesterday at five o&#39;clock, an enormous
rabble had surrounded the factory by Leman Street,
and there being no one in charge who could deal with
them, the hooligans had set the place on fire and
burned it to the ground. From that they had gone on
to other pleasantries, chiefly connected with the philanthropic
agencies in the East End. A mission had
been burned at Stepney; a boys&#39; institute at Bethnal
Green. There was hardly a baker&#39;s shop in the locality
which had not been looted, while some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
larger stores were but shattered ruins. The report
added that a vast horde of ruffians, numbering at least
two hundred thousand men, was then marching upon
Pall Mall, and that troops were being hurried to London.
It was altogether the most sensational affair
since the beginning of the frost.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor little Gabrielle!&quot; said Trevelle, thinking first
of the woman. &quot;I&#39;m glad she wasn&#39;t there. This will
be an awful blow to her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not if she&#39;s got the common sense I credit her
with. Women&#39;s ideals are not readily shaken, and
Miss Silvester has some big ones, which are permanent.
I&#39;ll see her to-day, and we&#39;ll know what&#39;s to be done.
Tell her as much when we get to London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If there is any London left to get to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! there&#39;ll be a nook and corner somewhere.
Your fellows have a genius for dealing with mobs.
I would back the police in London against all the
riff-raff east of St. Paul&#39;s. But they&#39;ll do some mischief,
none the less&mdash;and even this may not help us
for the moment. Do you guess what&#39;s in that cable,
Mr. Trevelle&mdash;why, how should you? And yet it
might mean more to your people to-day than ten million
sovereigns, counted out on the floor of Westminster
Hall!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He held up the familiar dirty paper upon which the
Post Office writes the most momentous of messages,
and then showed his companion that it had come from
Queenstown.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The men on my side have given in,&quot; he said, adding
nothing of his own act in that great matter, &quot;the
steamers will be sailing inside twenty-four hours. It&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
a race, sir, between me and the worst side of your
nation. And I guess I&#39;ll win.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you do,&quot; said Trevelle earnestly, &quot;there is nothing
our government can do to repay the debt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unless they teach the people the lesson of it; do
you think it is nothing to an American to see this great
country at the mercy of the first food panic which
overtakes her? I tell you, it is as much to my countrymen
as to yours. Teach them that they have a precious
possession in this island kingdom, and you are doing
a great work. I shall be a proud man to have a hand
in it&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You certainly will have that. It&#39;s a lesson we all
need. I don&#39;t think I could have repeated it myself,
but for these weeks. Now, I know&mdash;and the man who
knows can never forget.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He fell to silence upon it, and regarding the drear
country from the blurred window, perceived a barren
field and a drift of snow falling from a sullen sky. Yet
sore afflicted as she was, he remembered that this was
Mother England, and that he and countless others had
been but ungrateful sons in the days of her glory.</p>

<p class="indent">Would it be otherwise when the shadows had
passed?</p>

<p class="indent">Ah! who could tell?</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle was at her club in Burlington Gardens
when the news of the riot in Stepney was brought by
her father. She determined to go back at once that
she might know the worst.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can they say such things?&quot; she protested while
a footman helped her on with her furs, and her father
watched her humbly, as latterly it was his wont to do.
&quot;Why! everything is going so well, father. I had a
perfect ovation this morning; it was nearly half an
hour before I could get away from the people. Why
should they have done this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester said that he could not tell her. All that
he knew he had learned by the mouth of a messenger,
who had been dispatched headlong from Stepney and
came panting with the news.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You should not have listened to Mr. Faber, my
dear. He is an American, and he does not understand
our people. The ticket idea was quite wrong. It led
to many jealousies, and now to this. The people think
there is a great store of bread in Leman Street, and
that it is being given only to our friends. I am sorry
the story got abroad, very sorry! Charity cannot
discriminate in such times as these.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
He would have gone on to preach quite a little
sermon to the hall porter and the footmen, who told
each other afterward that the young lady gave it
to him &quot;&#39;ot&quot;&mdash;but Gabrielle, amazed and chagrined
beyond all experience, immediately ordered them to
get a taxi and drive without any delay to Stepney.
It was then about seven o&#39;clock of the evening; a
bitter cold night with a wraith of snow in the air.
The West End seemed entirely deserted at such an
hour&mdash;even the music-halls had no queues at their
doors, while the theatrical managers complained dolefully
of their financial sorrows. London had awakened
to the truth of the situation at last, and London was
frightened. Even the unobservant Silvester could
realise the omens of menace, and say that the city
was in peril.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what it means,&quot; he told Gabrielle,
as they drove, &quot;but I passed a regiment of cavalry as
I came here, and it was going toward Oxford Circus.
Do you notice how many police there are about, and
mounted police? There is hardly a shop in the West
End which is not boarded up. Perhaps they are wise&mdash;this
has taught them what lies on the other side of
Aldgate, and it is a lesson they should have learned a
long time ago. My own opinion is that we are upon
the brink of a revolution; though, of course, I would
not say as much to any of these newspaper people!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you think it, father, why not say it? Surely
the day has gone by for the old foolish ideas. The
government has left the people to starve, and must
take the consequences. We have done our best, but
we are not policemen. I feel tempted to go back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
Hampstead and having nothing more to do with it.
Think of the ingratitude, the shame of it all&mdash;and we
have worked so hard!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You should not have listened to Mr. Faber, my
dear; I said as much at the beginning. He is very
ignorant of English people; it was a mistake to listen
to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t think that on the steamer, father, when
we came over from America. You were his bravest
advocate; you called him one of the world&#39;s geniuses,
I remember it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester admitted it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hoped much from him. If we could have won
him, it would have been the greatest victory in the
cause of peace we have ever achieved. I fear now he
must be called our evil genius. He has undoubtedly
sold all those rifles to Germany, and that is to say
that we shall have the old foolish scares again and
very soon. A man like that is a terrible instrument
of mischief. I think we shall have to dissociate ourselves
from him altogether when the little girl is well
enough to leave us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle sighed as though all these things had become
a burden on her mind. An innate sympathy for
John Faber prevented her saying what otherwise it
would have been a truth to say. How much he could
have done for them had he chosen to do it! His
money would have helped them so&mdash;an inconsequent
thought, for her charities had never wanted money.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was certainly wrong about the tickets,&quot; she
admitted. &quot;I know Mr. Trevelle thought so, but he
gave way. If it is really true that he is keeping bread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
from the people to serve his own ends, nothing bad
enough can be said about it, but I want to know that
it is true. It has been very unkind of him to do
nothing for us when he might have done so much.
My opinion of him is greatly changed; I do not think
he is really our friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester was quite of that opinion also.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He made us such extravagant promises. A house
in the West End, motors&mdash;every luxury. I really
thought he was quite serious when I left Ragusa. Sir
Jules Achon did not wish us to go. He knows these
people; he thought I was ill-advised to give up Yonkers
for such vague promises. I wish I had listened
to him now; he is still on those delightful waters, far
away from all this. We should have been with him
but for our foolish generosity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle avoided the difficult subject. She must
have been a little ashamed of it when she remembered
the gifts John Faber had lavished upon them already
and the concern he displayed for Maryska. The conversation,
indeed, carried her back to a somewhat commonplace
reality from which she had emerged to win
this temporary triumph as a ministering angel in the
East End. And now they had burned her Temple and
the idol was cast down. Her father would send
Maryska away, and they must return to the old humdrum
life. John Faber and his riches would pass as
a ship of the night. Harry Lassett and the dead
leaves of a withered passion remained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; she said at last, &quot;how vain is all we do! How
vain, how hopeless! We are just like ants crawling
about the earth and trying to set ourselves up for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
gods. We talk of peace and war, of good and evil, of
what we shall accomplish and what we have done, and
then down comes the great flat foot of circumstance
and out we go. I lose the power even to hope sometimes.
Why should we not let things drift? Who is
the better for our work?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her father would not agree to that.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Every stone cast into the lake of the world&#39;s ills
is an asset in humanity&#39;s balance sheet,&quot; he said. &quot;You
have cast many, Gabrielle, and will add to the number.
Look out there at those poor people. Is it all
vain when you remember how many of their kind you
have succoured? This American hardness is no good
influence; I wish we could shake it off forever. Indeed,
it were better so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall do that,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Mr. Faber
will not be many days in England when the frost will
let him get away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He remained silent. They had passed Charing
Cross, and now their way was blocked by a vast torchlight
procession of women, debouching upon the
Strand from the neighbourhood of the Old Kent Road.
It was a sorry spectacle, for here were young and old,
white-haired women with their backs bent toward
the earth which soon would receive them; drabs in
rags who flaunted their tattered beauty in the face
of every male; quiet workers whose children were
starving in garrets; women from mean streets who
had never begged in all their lives; children who wondered
if the end of the world had come. Headed
by a lank harridan who wore a crimson shawl and
carried an immense torch, these miserables tramped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
stolidly toward the West End, seeking God knows
what relief from the shuttered houses. And after them
went a dozen mounted policemen, good-humoured,
chubby-cheeked fellows, who had never wanted bread
and were never out of patience with others less
fortunate.</p>

<p class="indent">A thousand expressions were to be read upon the
faces of this haggard crew, and not a little fine determination.
Here would be a woman reeling in drink;
yonder a young mother hardly strong enough to walk
the streets. There were sluts and shapely girls, creatures
of a shabby finery, and hopeless woebegone figures
of an unchanging poverty. From time to time
wistful glances would be cast up at the lighted windows
of the houses as though succour might be cast
down thence. All moved with rapid, shuffling steps, an
orderly concourse which concealed the forces of disorder.
By here and there, some of the younger
members broke into a mournful song, which was
checked at intervals to permit of the exchange of
coarse wit with the passers-by on the pavements. The
whole throng seemed driven relentlessly on toward a
nameless goal which must break their hope when at
last they reached it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t it dreadful to see them?&quot; said Gabrielle when
the last of the procession had passed by and traffic in
the Strand was resumed once more. &quot;This sort of
thing affects me terribly; it makes me feel sorry that
there are women in the world at all. Think of the
children of such creatures! What can we hope for
them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the children for whom we must work,&quot; rejoined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
the father. &quot;I should think of England with
despair if it were not for the children.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Worthy man! Despair had always been among the
wares in his basket; and yet, how often had this unhappy
British people gone laughing by with never a
thought for him or his melancholy gospel?</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">The menace of the streets was not less when the
women had passed by and the traffic flowed again.</p>

<p class="indent">London was full of wild mobs that night; of savage
men and men made savage by hunger, and they were
drifted to and fro upon the shifting seas of authority
and stranded on many a relentless shore. There was
riot, too, and upon riot, pillage and the incendiary.
Now for the first time since the winter set in, hunger
drove even the orderly to the West in the wild search
for the food the East could not give them. Long
through the dark hours, in Bond Street, in Piccadilly,
by Hyde Park, away in the remotest suburbs, sleepers
were awakened to listen fearfully to the tramp of feet
and the hoarse voices of the multitudes. Those who
had the curiosity to look from their windows beheld a
sky quivering with light, a glorious iridescence above
many a flaming building the rioters had fired. It was
the beginning of the end, men said; a visitation of
Almighty God against which all were impotent. Who
shall wonder that those whose faith was sure prayed
for the salvation of their country in that hour of her
need?</p>

<p class="indent">There were enormous crowds about Aldgate, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
the taxi containing Gabrielle and her father made but
slow headway. When at last it entered Leman Street,
they perceived in an instant the whole extent of the
disaster; and so irreparable it seemed that the girl&#39;s
pride broke down utterly, and she shed bitter tears
of shame and grief. How she had worked for these
people! What a heroine they had made of her! This
very morning there had been a kind of triumphal
procession from the old Temple to the new. She had
been followed by a vast concourse of thankful people,
who cheered her as she went; while the bishop had
addressed the throngs from the doors of the mission,
and spoken of the &quot;noble lady,&quot; whose services to
them had been priceless. This was just eight hours
ago, and now there were but reddening ashes where
the workers had stood to give the children bread.</p>

<p class="indent">The cab made its way to the doors of the wrecked
building and an inspector of police received them. The
few who had been admitted within the barriers were
evidently ashamed of what had been done, but quite
unable to apologise for it. The inspector put it down
to the hooligans.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We breed too many of them in these days, sir,&quot;
he said, &quot;the country finds it out when there&#39;s hard
times, and God knows they&#39;re hard enough now. It
must have been set afire after Mr. Gedding had locked
it up for the day. There were flames as tall as chimneys
coming out of the roof when I was called.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was a man who took tragedy as a matter of
course, and would have used the same words if St.
Paul&#39;s had been burned. When asked if the incendiary
were taken, he replied that he was not, but that acting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
upon &quot;information received,&quot; he hoped to make an
arrest before morning. His anxiety for the &quot;young
lady&quot; was real, and he advised that she should return
immediately to her home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now that there&#39;s this spirit abroad, I&#39;ll answer for
nothing at all,&quot; he said; &quot;you&#39;d be better the other
side of Aldgate, and that&#39;s certain. There&#39;s nothing
but a pack of foreign cut-throats in the streets to-night,
and no man is safe. Just you take my advice,
sir, and come back in the morning, when they&#39;ve had
time to cool awhile. This is no place for the young
lady, whatever it may be for us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester agreed with him, but he found it impossible
to influence Gabrielle. She seemed strangely
moved by the melancholy glamour of the scene; by
the savage figures shadowed in the after-glow; by the
reddening skeleton of the Temple which stood up so
proudly a few hours ago. To-morrow there would be
but a pit of ashes, where to-day a sacrifice had been
offered to the nation. She suffered profoundly when
she surveyed this wreck of her handiwork, and it
seemed to her that her work among the people was
done.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us go on to the old Temple,&quot; she said with
what resignation she could command, &quot;if they have
burned that also, then I will return with you, father,
for I can do nothing more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester disliked the idea of it. He would have
been pleased enough to have been back in his little
study at Hampstead, where he might have composed
a sermon upon &quot;ingratitude,&quot; as an obstacle; but he
had long been schooled to obedience when his daughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
commanded, and so they re-entered the cab and drove
to the old Temple. A silent multitude watched them
as they went, but none cheered. The bitter cold night
either sent people to their houses, where they might
shiver upon heaps of rags, or it drove them to the
open street where many a huge fire had been kindled
that the outcasts might warm themselves. Hereabouts
you would often see a whole family lying upon a filthy
pallet of straw, and so huddled together for warmth
that it had the appearance of some fearsome animal
which had crawled from the darkness to the light.
The shadows gave pictures more terrible, husbanding
the dying and the dead. Starvation abetted the rigour
of the winter. Nature waged war here in these silent
alleys, and no sound attended her stealthy victories,
which were multitudinous.</p>

<p class="indent">In London beyond &quot;the gate&quot; there were other
anxieties, but these poor people knew nothing of them.
War and its menace: the chimera of fabled foes crossing
the black ice in endless columns; cannon rumbling
where ships had sailed; England no longer an island,
her ramparts of blue waters gathered up; her gates
thrown open to any who would affront her&mdash;if the
West End discussed all this covertly and as though
afraid, the East knew nothing of it. Here the danger
was not of to-morrow, but of to-night! The peril,
ever present, fell upon them now at the bidding of
the natural law. For the first time since the outcasts
of the world had found sanctuary beyond Aldgate,
their city of refuge had been unable to feed them.
And now hunger bade them go forth to the land of
promise, so near, so rich in all they needed. Shall we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
wonder that starving mobs gathered in every square;
that the courts were full of desperadoes with murder
in their eyes; that even the honest would listen and
admit that this or that might be done?</p>

<p class="indent">Upon the other side were the police and the soldiers,
many thousands hidden prudently from the eyes of
the mobs. If the Government could do little to feed
these people, it could, at least, protect the people who
were fed for the time being, at any rate. Commanded
by the &quot;man of iron,&quot; the cavalry were marched hither
and thither, but always to form a cordon about the
dangerous areas. Special drafts of constables came
from the distant suburbs to overawe poor devils whose
greatest crime was their hunger. Stepney was besieged
by authority, fearful that men would go out
to get the children bread, and ashamed that bread
should be withheld. Here had Nature&#39;s war become
one of a civil people, paying a debt they long had owed
to their exacting creditors, &quot;Want of Forethought
and Economy.&quot; The sword of a foreign enemy would
have been the lesser peril&mdash;it was evident enough now
to everyone!</p>

<p class="indent">Through such scenes, by the dark and dangerous
streets, went Gabrielle to the ancient Temple. She
found it occupied by busy missionaries, who knew
neither night nor day while the work of mercy must
go on. In and out they went as they returned from
some mean house, or set off for another. Dawn found
them still at work, the terrible dawn when the country
waited for the verdict in Nature&#39;s court, and even the
dullest had come to know that this was an island kingdom.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span></p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">Faber and Trevelle reached Stepney early on the
morning of the following day. Gabrielle was still at
the Temple and while she had expected the visit of the
resistless &quot;inspiration,&quot; as she had come to call Trevelle,
John Faber&#39;s advent was unlooked for.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We heard you were burned out, and came along
at once,&quot; he said, in the best of humours. &quot;I guess
you&#39;ll want all the masons you&#39;ve got, Miss Silvester,
and want &#39;em on time. That old factory should take
five days to put up if you go the right way about it.
If it were me, I&#39;d leave it where it is, and make &#39;em
toe the line among the ashes. That would teach them
to behave themselves next time. You can&#39;t burn the
house that&#39;s been burned already, and if they want
to warm themselves, coal is cheaper. Say, write that
upon what&#39;s left of the door, and you&#39;ll have the
laugh on them, sure!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was chagrined at the tone of it, but none the
less, she seemed to understand that he wished her well.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If we rebuild, where is the money to come from?&quot;
she asked him, helplessly. &quot;And what is the good of
it if there is no bread to give the people? My father
says the end is coming. What have we to hope for
if that is the case?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have to hope for many things, my dear
young lady&mdash;the weather for one of them. Your
good father is a little premature, maybe, and is prone
to believe what the newspapers tell him. The end
is coming sure enough. It&#39;s not the end he looks for
by a long way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
He glanced at Trevelle, and they smiled together.
There had been great news from Queenstown that
morning. Why should they withhold it from her?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fact is,&quot; said Trevelle, &quot;the strike in America
is over and the wheat ships are sailing. You read
your evening paper to-night and see what it says. We
have brains amongst us and they are busy. That&#39;s
what we&#39;ve been asking for all along, in peace or
war, not the dreamers but the brains. And we&#39;ve
got &#39;em, Miss Silvester, we&#39;ve got &#39;em!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He snapped his fingers, an habitual gesture, and
seemed thereby to imply that he, Rupert Trevelle,
had laid down a doctrine which henceforth must be
the salvation of the British people. Gabrielle, however,
heard him a little coldly though she was full of
wonder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not think you were so interested in this
matter,&quot; she said. And then, &quot;Will you, please, tell
me why the men in Liverpool are striking still?&quot;
When the scientific exposition had left her more in
doubt than ever, she asked of her work once more.
&quot;Then it is no good going on here if the wheat will
come in,&quot; she said; &quot;our task will be finished then,
will it not, Mr. Faber?&quot; He shook his head at that
and told her of his fears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be a slow business. I advise you to stand
by yet awhile. If we get the cargoes slowly, as we
shall have to do, the price of wheat will still stand
high, and that&#39;s no good to these people at all. Take
my advice and go on with what you are doing. The
country owes you something, sure, and it is just beginning
to find that out. Did you see your pictures in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
the halfpenny illustrateds, this morning? I like those
fine; I&#39;ve got &#39;em here somewhere, and I mean to
keep &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trevelle thought it wise to move away at this
point, and they were left together in the great bare
hall of the Temple, whither the people would soon be
flocking for bread. A winter sun shone cold and
clear through the wide window above them; then
voices echoed strangely beneath the vault as though
they were tricked by a mutual self-restraint to an
artificiality of tone foreign to them. This man had
come to love this woman passionately, and he was
about to go to his own country, never to return.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried, surprised and delighted when
she beheld the pictures, &quot;what a dreadful guy they
have made me! Now, don&#39;t you think this sort of
thing ought to be stopped?&quot; He shook his head as
though she had disappointed him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never knew a woman yet whose picture was in
a newspaper who didn&#39;t say they had guyed her. The
thing seems well enough to me, and I must keep it for
a better. Say, now, you know, I&#39;m going away the
first mail that sails. Will you give me a better portrait
or must I take this one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her spirit fell though she did not dare to tell him
why. He was going, and the building her hope had
raised must come crashing down. With this was her
feeling that in some way he had failed her in the
critical hours. There were men who cried out upon
his astuteness, made manifest in the hour of crisis,
but she had never heeded them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you really think that you will remember my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
name when you are in New York again&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Her
hesitation was the complement of the obvious, and he
smiled again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be a new name. Let&#39;s hear how it sounds.
Mrs. Harry Lassett! Well, I don&#39;t like the sound of
it overmuch, but I suppose it&#39;s not my say. The
wedding, I think, is for next month, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the week before Lent. You will not build
me a Temple now; it would be a mockery!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, as to that, if it&#39;s a Temple for brains, I
don&#39;t know that we mightn&#39;t build it after all. That&#39;s
what your country needs, Miss Gabrielle. All the
brains at work to educate the people. Sentiment will
carry you a very little way upon the road. Let your
Temple go up to the men with brains.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; she said, &quot;I think we are all beginning to
understand that. Even my father says that universal
peace will be won by the intellect not by the heart
of the nation. You will see him before you go, of
course?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall try to; it will be a misfortune for me if
I do not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Maryska?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, there you get me into harbour at once. I&#39;ve
been thinking over what Mr. Trevelle has told me
about your difficulties, and I guess I&#39;d better see you
out of them by taking Maryska to New York. Does
that seem to you a wise thing to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her face became very pale, her thoughts seemed
distant when she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite wise; she will never be well in England.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or happy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
&quot;Ah, who can say just what happiness is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True enough,&quot; he replied. &quot;We look up and down
the street for it, and sometimes it is on our own doorsteps
all the time. We say that we were happy yesterday,
and talk of happy days to come when to-day may
be the happiest of our lives. Some of us are not
born for that ticket, and it&#39;s human nature which
shuts us out from it. Who knows, you and I may be
among the number.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An auspicious thing to say, remembering that I
am to be married next month.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me, I should not have said it. It&#39;s like
one of your Lord Salisbury&#39;s &#39;blazing indiscretions.&#39;
You are taking the line which your welfare dictates
that you shall take. You have thought this out for
some years, I don&#39;t doubt, and you say, there is just
one man in the whole world for you. Well, that&#39;s a
bid for happiness any way. I&#39;ll put a motto to it
when I cable you on your wedding day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He held out his hand, and she took it. Their eyes
met, and he knew that he read her story.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Temple,&quot; he said; &quot;I guess you&#39;ll want me
to help you open that. If you do, I&#39;ll come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I write to Charleston?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, to Maryska de Paleologue, who is going to
keep house for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her hand fell from his and she said no more. The
doors of the Temple were already open that the hungry
might enter in.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4-2" id="ch4-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">THE SHADOW IS LIFTED</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">When a woman has drifted into an engagement imposed
upon her by years of friendship, it is rare
that she has the courage to break the bonds, however
irksome she may find them.</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle knew that she was drifting into this marriage
with Harry Lassett, and yet her will was paralysed.
The baser appeal had passed as a menacing
wave upon a strange sea, and all that was left was the
troubled waters of the seemingly inevitable. Her love-making
had been so many hours of a dead passion,
which no pretence could reanimate. She had posed
as the fond mistress of a man whom her coldness
gradually repelled until his pride revolted. Held in
his arms, treated still as the child, kissed upon her
lips, all her sentiment appealed to by his ardour, she
tried to say that this was her destiny, beyond which
she might not look. Hundreds had drifted as she into
that desert of the waters where no tide of life emerges
nor harbours of a man&#39;s love are to be found. She
had been tricked by circumstance, and delusion must
be paid for by the years.</p>

<p class="indent">Be it said that this was chiefly an aftermath of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
busy weeks. While the shadow lay upon England,
the fame of her work had blinded her to the true
meaning of the promise Harry Lassett had won from
her in an irresponsible hour. Swiftly, upon the tide
of the national misfortune, she had risen to notoriety;
been applauded in the public press and named as a
heroine for her work at Stepney. When that work
was ended; when England awoke one day to the thunders
of a thanksgiving more real than any in her story,
then she learned for the first time by what means her
triumph had been won, and whose hand had guided
her through the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">The letter came from Paris, one of the very first
the mails brought in. Well she remembered afterwards
how that there had been a bruit of the passing
of the frost many days before the deliverance came.
Crowds who had learned to say that the American engineer,
John Faber, had been the master mind during
the terrible weeks; that his were the wheat ships now
coming into the ports; that his genius and his money
had accomplished miracles&mdash;these crowds heard with
new hope of his promise that the weather was breaking,
and the end at hand. Waiting patiently during
the momentous hours, London slept one night through
a bitter frost to awake next day to a warm south
wind and a burning sunshine. Never shone sun so
kindly upon a people which mourned its heritage.
The oldest became as children in that hour of deliverance.
The church bells rang for a peace, not with
men, but with God.</p>

<p class="indent">The island home! God, what it had meant to
them all in the past! And they had dwelt in ignorance;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
blind to their possession; regardless of the good
sea which sheltered them; of the ramparts which were
their salvation. Now, as in a flash, they perceived
the truth: the gifts were returned to them; the meanest
knew that he was free. In a frenzy which the circumstances
may have justified, men took train for the
seaports and watched the passing of the ice. They
stood upon the high cliffs and beheld the sun shining
upon the open waters; lakes of golden light at the
heart of the ocean&mdash;a widening girdle of security
their country had put on. The loftiest imagination
could not soar to the true heights of this revelation, or
embrace it wholly in the earlier hours. The dullest
were dumb for very fear that the Almighty would but
trick them after all.</p>

<p class="indent">In London, it was as though the whole people took
one great breath together. Just as upon the conclusion
of a peace, the church bells were rung and the City
illuminated. Vast crowds poured from the houses,
and gave themselves up to the most childish manifestations
of joy. There were scenes to disgrace the story;
scenes to lift it to great nobility. But yesterday, it had
seemed to some of these revellers that they were no
longer the inhabitants of an island which the strongest
power would hesitate to assail. All the tradition
and glory of the kingdom had gone out of it&mdash;to return
in a twinkling at the passing of the frost.</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle could hear the church bells ringing in
Hampstead, but the theme of their chime was less to
her than the letter which Eva Achon had written to
her from Paris&mdash;a girlish, gossiping letter, full of inconsequential
chatter about absurd people, and ending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
ever upon the tonic chord of the masculine scale.
Eva&#39;s Odyssey had been full of event, but she had
returned to Paris as a maiden Helen, torn by imagination
only from the phantom bridegroom of her
dreams. Incidentally, and as though it had to do with
a fair in a remote country, she spoke of the great strike
and of the man whose name was upon every tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father thinks very highly of Mr. John Faber,&quot;
she wrote. &quot;He would very much like to work with
him. I wrote to Rupert Trevelle about it, but he
seems too busy to remember me now. It was so like an
American to spend all that money on charity and leave
the people to think he was a scoundrel. The truth
came out from Mr. Morris, who made what he called
a &#39;great story&#39; and sent it to America. I am sending
you the cutting from the <i>New York Herald</i>&mdash;it has
also been in the English <i>Times</i>, I think. All the English
people here are gone mad to know Mr. Faber
now&mdash;they say he is one of the cleverest men in the
world, and one of the kindest. All the same, my father
says his brains are better than his money, and when
you come to think of it, I suppose that must always be
the case. Even he, rich as he is, could do little for
that poor artist, Louis de Paleologue, and now there
comes the news from Montey that Claudine&#39;s <i>fianc√©</i>
has been terribly hurt at the aviation meeting there,
and is hardly expected to live. So you see, dearest
Gabrielle, his money seems to bring ill-luck to everyone;
but when he works, there is no one like him.
If only he would help father, how much he could do
for the world! But, I suppose, he is going back to
America, and we shall see him no more.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
&quot;And that reminds me. Isn&#39;t it provoking how
many people we never see any more! I have had a
delicious flirtation here with a fair man whose name
I don&#39;t know. We passed each other on the stairs of
the hotel nearly every morning, and one day I dropped
my bag, and he picked it up and spoke to me. I was
frightened to ask anyone who he was, and I never
saw him in the <i>salle √† manger</i>, but he used to pass
me on the stairs&mdash;oh, quite six or seven times a day
after that; and we had such a jolly time. Then, suddenly,
he went away, never said a word to me or wrote
any letter. I shall never see him any more&mdash;<i>mais tout
bien ou rien</i>, if it were always to be on the stairs,
I am glad that he is gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">A tinkling gong called Gabrielle to lunch, and she
found her father alone in the dining-room. A mutual
question as to Maryska&#39;s whereabouts revealed the
fact that she had not been seen since breakfast and
that none of the servants had news of her. Once or
twice before, when Harry Lassett had been cajoled
into some wild excursion, Maryska had spent most of
the day out of doors; but both Silvester and his daughter
seemed to think that this was not such an occasion,
and they were troubled accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I really fear that it is time that Mr. Faber took
charge of her,&quot; Silvester said, as he sat down wearily.
&quot;She is very self-willed, and we have no hold over
her. Would Harry be responsible for this, do you
think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
&quot;How can he be? Is he not at Brighton? I hardly
think that even he would keep the child out without
a word to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester looked at her shrewdly. That &quot;even he&quot;
suggested a train of thought which had been forced
upon him more than once latterly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think it is wise for Harry to take her
out at all, Gabrielle?&quot; he asked. &quot;We treat her
as a child, but is she one really? I hope our confidence
is not misplaced. We should incur a very grave
responsibility if it were.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle did not like Maryska, and was hardly one
to conceal her prejudices.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We should never have consented to receive her,
father. It was all done in such a hurry; I think we
were the victims of our own good nature. Who is
she? Where does she come from? A gipsy girl,
perhaps, and one who dislikes our country, and us.
It was sentiment upon Mr. Faber&#39;s part&mdash;altruism at
our expense. Of course, he talks of taking her ultimately
to New York. But is he likely to do that?
Do you believe that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must believe it or say that he has not written
the truth. There was a letter from him this morning&mdash;you
will find it on my study table. He wishes us
to keep her at least for a time and until he can make
some provision for her in America. It will be possible
for him to sail to-day, he thinks, if Sir Jules Achon
arrives from Cherbourg. He appears to want to see
Sir Jules very much before he goes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then Maryska remains, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the present, yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
&quot;And that is the last we are to see of our friend?
Well, our castles come tumbling down, at any rate.
We have been his builders, but he leaves us a wretched
house. I think you would be wiser to go to Yonkers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think so, too&mdash;when you and Harry are married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Need Harry and I enter into the matter? I am
thinking all the time of the way these clever men make
less clever people their dupes. Sometimes I say that
what I need to make a success of my life is the help
of a man of genius. I felt it every day when Mr.
Faber was here. It was to stand upon a rock and
laugh when the sea flowed all around. And you need
it too, father. Think of all that good men might do
in the world if they had brains such as his behind
them. He preaches all his sermons from that text.
Brains will save the people, the country, even religion.
I am sick of sentiment; it accomplishes nothing. We
have meetings and speakers, and conferences and discussions,
and the world just goes laughing by, like a
boy who passes the open door of a schoolroom. What
have we done since we left America? How have we
helped our great cause? You know what the answer
must be. We have done less than nothing, while a
stranger has made our people think and learn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was much taken aback by her outburst, and a
little at a loss. A man of high ideals, he knew how
hopeless was the task of uplifting the people, and yet
hope and endeavour were the breath of life to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;I won&#39;t say that we have done
nothing. This dreadful winter is just what has been
needed to make the people think. A reaction will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
follow, and we shall go to them with a message of
peace they cannot resist. I am sure the truth will
come home to all now. It will be easy to say that God
Almighty did not create mankind for the shambles.
What astonishes me, Gabrielle, is that in this twentieth
century it should be necessary to preach such a
doctrine at all. When you consider what universal
peace would mean in every home in the country, what
it would do for the poorest, how it would help the children,
I am altogether at a loss. The thing is an incredible
anachronism giving the lie direct to Christ
and His gospel. And we are powerless to cope with
it; we seem to address those whose hearts are of
stone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why do you address them? That is just
what Mr. Faber asks. Why not turn to those who
can lead the people? If the great names of Europe
and America were behind you, the millennium would
come. I myself would hope more from two such men
as Sir Jules Achon and John Faber than from all the
sermons in the world. But I have become a very
practical person, father. I think sometimes I am
growing terribly masculine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You always used to be, Gabrielle. I remember
when you were the greatest tomboy in Hampstead.
That, by the way, was before your engagement to
Harry. Do you know, my dear girl, I wonder sometimes
if marriage is your destiny at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If not marriage, what then, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Public work. The practice of the ideas you have
just been pleading to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle shook her head. She spoke with little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
restraint, and in a way that astonished him altogether.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t agree with you. I believe in my heart
that I am destined to love and marriage. If it is not
so, I may do something mad some day. Sometimes
I long to get away from all this; but it must be with
a man who can lead me. I shall never marry Harry&mdash;I
wonder that I have not told him so before. Perhaps
I should have done so had it not been for these
awful weeks. Do you know, father, that I find life in
opposition to every convention you have taught me
since I was a child? There are no fairy godmothers
in the world. Our guardian angels might be gamblers
who throw us headlong into the stream and make
wagers about our condition when we come out. We
have to decide the most momentous questions when
we are still babies and understand nothing about
them. In the end it comes just to what Mr. Faber
says, our brains make or mar us; and neither you nor
I have any brains to speak of. Let us leave it there,
father. I am growing really anxious about the child,
and must know the truth. If she is not with the
Bensons, I don&#39;t know where she is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He assented, moved to some real anxiety by her
obvious alarm. They wrote a note and dispatched it
to the house of their friends the Bensons, who had
shown much kindness to Maryska, but the afternoon
had merged into evening before any answer was
brought to them.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span></p>

<h2><a name="ch4-3" id="ch4-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">THE MARIGOLDS TO THE SUN</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska had been out and about London with
Harry Lassett upon more than one occasion, and this
had been to the knowledge and with the approval both
of Silvester and of Gabrielle. Both had known Harry
for many years, and he had become almost as the son
of the house. Their own duties carried them so much
abroad during the terrible days that they were well
content when the young man did what he could to
amuse the child during the long hours; and they
used to hear of the mutual escapades with the interest
they would have bestowed upon two children come
home from school and eager for the holidays.</p>

<p class="indent">Here their trust went out wholly upon their own
plane of honor and convention. The boy had been
to a public school and to Cambridge. He was of a
type which three hundred years of a great tradition
have moulded finally and left as a corner-stone of the
national society. A firm faith in the blessings of domestic
freedom had always been characteristic of Silvester&#39;s
teaching. Trust your sons, and they will not
fail you, he had said.</p>

<p class="indent">But, if he knew that Harry had taken Maryska to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
such places as a young woman of her age (and one
who was a stranger to the City) might visit, he would
have been astounded and dismayed had he known that
she had gone to Harry&#39;s lodgings, and latterly had
made a practice of visiting him there. This was concealed
by both as a secret between them of which no
whisper must be heard. It was the first scene of an
act of drama speedily to follow. Maryska would
never forget that day. They had been to Madame
Tussaud&#39;s, where a wretched group of people were
sheltered from the cold, and tried to forget the shadow
which lay upon the City. Returning towards five
o&#39;clock, Maryska had told him that she knew the truth
about England at last, and that it was the arctic
land of which her dead father had told her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They come here in little ships,&quot; she said, &quot;and
it is to find <i>le P√¥le Nord</i>. There was a caf√© of that
name in Dijon, and once when we were very poor I
danced there and got money for him. He beat me
when he found it out, and that night I hated him,
and went back to dance once more. That is what a
girl should do when a man beats her! Ah! I shall
run away from you yet, <i>b√™te sauvage</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed in a great boyish way, and drew her
arm the tighter within his own. How good it seemed
to have these bright eyes looking up into his own, to
hear the little savage prattling, and to know that she
was happy. Though the kingdom of England had
perished that night, these two would not have cared
a scudo. The eternal voice of youth called them, and
they bent to it as &quot;marigolds to the sun.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think I shall beat you, Maryska? Is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
in your head? You are a rum little devil, I must
say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She took it rather as a compliment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not know what you will do when you are
angry. The English are difficult to understand. I
think they are afraid of women. Mr. Silvester runs
away when I stamp my foot. I have heard him shut
his door when I come down the stairs. <i>Bon Dieu!</i>
what a cat of a man&mdash;and he is a priest, and the people
do not know that he is afraid of women! Shall
we go to your lodgings, Harry&mdash;shall I make you
some coffee there? It will be ripping,&mdash;and they
would be so angry if they knew. Let us hurry on, for
it is late&mdash;to your lodgings, I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was a good deal taken aback, and argued with
her while she trotted by his side; all her strength
returned, all her youth triumphant. To his rooms!
That was a new proposition, to be sure. And what
would Gabrielle say if she knew of it?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, Maryska, people will talk if you come
to my lodgings!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will they not talk if I stop away?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;ll say rotten things. I shouldn&#39;t like to have
them said about you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Harry, do you always live alone in your
rooms?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t take ladies there, Maryska.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was amazed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not wicked to be with you in the street, then,
but wicked in your rooms. <i>Ecco!</i> what a country!
And all the people are frozen and the wind eats them
up, and they are so frightened of us they lock us out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
of their lodgings. How <i>he</i> would have laughed!
Why, all the ladies in Ragusa came to his room, and
he would sing and laugh all day. It was not wicked
there! He would not have done it when I was with
him, if it had been.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He tried to tell her that countries have different
customs, and that what is done in the south may not
be done in the north with impunity. But she was
wholly unconvinced, and the spice of daring being
added to the dish of her thoughts, she led him insensibly
towards Holly Place and not towards Well Walk
as they approached Hampstead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just to see what this wicked place is like, Harry.
Surely, I may stand at your door and see you go in?
They will not punish me, these horrid English, for
that. Oh, yes, I shall stand at your door and see
you go in, and you will give me some wine. Do you
know that we have nothing but syrup at the Silvesters&#39;?
Oh, <i>mon pauvre</i>! it is all ice inside as well as
out. I go thirsty all day&mdash;there was wine always
when <i>he</i> was alive, and now there is none! I shall
wait upon your doorway until you give me a little
wine, Harry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This idea pleased her very much, and she danced
and sang her way through the silent streets upon it.
Even the searching cold of the early night did not
affright her, nor those suggestions of loneliness and
isolation which usually attended her journey northward.
She was going to see Harry&#39;s rooms and to
drink some wine when she got there! The fact that he
had nothing but good Scotch whisky did not enter
into her calculations.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
As for Harry, the proposal annoyed him at the
beginning, but grew upon his sympathies as they went.
He tried to follow her logic, and to think that it would
be absurd to treat her otherwise than as a child. What
harm could there be after all, and was not her view
of it safer than his own? The Silvesters were too
busy looking after impossible people in the East End
to do their duty by this little exile. What forbade
him to treat her as a sister? Upon this there came
tumbling many a picture of that bewitching apparition
as sympathy could frame it. What a riot she
would make in his puny lodging! And how good it
would be to watch her swinging her shapely legs on
the edge of his pet arm-chair! She filled the whole
house with visions already.</p>

<p class="indent">They marched up Heath Street forlorn, wind-swept,
and deserted, and came at last to his door. He
remembered how easily she took possession of the
place, marching here and there as though she were its
mistress&mdash;setting this or that in order instantly; tidying
his desk; looking reproachfully upon his joyous
negligence. When a lean landlady asked her genially
if she would take a little tea, she answered immediately,
&quot;No; you are to go to the caf√© for the wine,
Mr. Harry will give you the money!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Harry gave it, as though it was the best of
jokes, and one in which he must now play his part.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">The first of many visits&mdash;how soon it was forgotten,
that others more intimate should be remembered!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
She came almost every day during the final week
of the tribulation, and would sit with him, smoking
his cigarettes and drinking his claret as though his
house had been a caf√©! He discovered that she had
many talents, was a rare dancer of the wild, uncouth
dances of the East, and could draw with a wonderful
sense of portraiture. Her pictures of Silvester should
have gone to <i>Punch</i>, but her portraits of Gabrielle
were full of feeling. One day, when she had been
sitting upon the arm of his chair, using his broad back
for an easel, she asked him, √† propos nothing at all,
if he were in love, and when he looked at her astonished
she seemed insistent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you in love with her, Harry? Why do you
not answer me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, you know that I am. Aren&#39;t we going to be
married, little Gipsy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She put the pencil down and laid her head quietly
upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall never believe it; you do not love her&mdash;she
is nothing to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, come, Gipsy! What do you know about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed, but did not raise her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you loved Gabrielle Silvester you would not
let me come to this house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not, Gipsy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I love you, Harry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So there it was, in a flash, and both her arms were
about his neck and her lips hot upon his own. She
loved him and had no shame in the avowal. Destiny
gave him to her. The little wild girl who came God
knew whence, was not this her haven at last? She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
entered into her heritage fiercely as one who would
not be dispossessed.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, Harry treated it as a good joke, or perhaps
attempted so to treat it. He could not resist
her kisses and made no effort to do so; but when
she had calmed down a little and he had pulled her
on to his knees so that he could look deep into her
black eyes, he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We mustn&#39;t tell Gabrielle about this; we mustn&#39;t
say a word just yet, Gipsy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thought about it, pulling at the button of his
vest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you wish to love me in secret, Harry?&quot; she
asked presently. He laughed again at that, and said
it would be a good joke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gabrielle will never marry me; I know that,
Gipsy. She&#39;s gone on your American friend, and is
too proud to tell him so. Our affair was all a mistake.
Time will put that right, and then you and I
will be free. Let&#39;s keep it secret, and have the laugh
of them all. Will you do that, Maryska?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes were wide open; she made an effort to
understand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do not forbid me to love you, Harry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly not; aren&#39;t we pals?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I may come here just when I like?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As long as Silvester doesn&#39;t get mad about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thought upon this, but half satisfied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you take me to Paris some day? I want so
much to go to Paris. There is life there&mdash;life, life,
life! One sits in the door of the hotel and sees all
the world. These English people make me hate them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
but I love the French as my father did. They said
in Paris that he was a great artist; I know it was
true. He could have compelled all the world to say
so if he had not been so idle. There were whole weeks
in Ragusa when he lay in bed; sometimes we had no
food in the house; then he would paint, and I would
go with the picture to the Jew with the beard and
bring the money home. That night was always a
<i>festa</i>. It was better in Paris, where he had many
friends who would come and say, &#39;Work, beast!&#39; and
he would laugh at them and take up his brushes. You
know that he was a prince in his own country, Harry?
Once when he was very ill, he told me so and gave
me some papers. That was at San Gimignano&mdash;oh!
so many years ago. When he got better he took them
away again, and we travelled and travelled, just like
two gipsies, together upon the lonely white roads.
At last we reached Granada, where there is a mountain
with gipsies, running in and out of their holes
like the rabbits in the forest. We lived with them a
month and he painted many pictures; then we took ship
and went to Italy, and he was so ill that I knew we
should never go over the white roads together again.
Ah, dear God! what a life I have led! and now you&mdash;you
are the only one in all the world, Harry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She hid her face from him and put her arms about
his neck again. Her passionate story moved him
strangely and seemed to set her in a new aspect before
him. Was it possible that this waif was what the
dead artist had proclaimed her to be? Beneath all
the sorry veneer of the <i>Wanderjahre</i>, would he find at
last the grains of nobility and of a precious birthright?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
That would mean very much to a man of
his temperament; to one whose whole career had
taught him to esteem these things. The mystery of
it all fascinated him strangely&mdash;she frightened him in
such moods as this.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not promise to take her to Paris, but, comforting
her with fair words, they went round together
to Well Walk and he saw Gabrielle for a few brief
moments. The talk between them was quite commonplace,
but, as often before, the name of John Faber
quickly crept into it. Harry turned his heel upon
that, and went back to Holly Place in high dudgeon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God!&quot; he said. &quot;That man again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Why did she not tell him frankly that her ambition
lay here and would not be rebuffed?</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">He had been very proud of Gabrielle in the old
days, and was proud still in a vain boyish way. He
knew that she was a beautiful woman, and could suffer
chagrin when he admitted that the measure of her
intellect was far beyond his own. A sportsman and
little else, all this cant of movements and causes and
social creeds stirred him to ebullitions of temper of
which he was secretly ashamed. Nothing but the
influence of years forbade him to say that both of
them had made a great mistake, and that he must
end it. He resolved to do so after Maryska&#39;s avowal,
but his courage was not responsive. He could not
bring himself to what must seem in Gabrielle&#39;s eyes
but a vulgar affront upon her loyalty&mdash;and so the days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
drifted. In the end he made up his mind to leave
London for a week or so and trust to new scenes for
inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">By all accounts John Faber was about to sail from
England, and, having altered his plans at the last
moment, Maryska had been left with the Silvesters&mdash;to
her great grief but not to Gabrielle&#39;s dissatisfaction.
Harry knew little of the circumstances, for his friends
at Hampstead were secretive, and latterly had become
unaccountably vague in all their plans. That John
Faber&#39;s departure was a great disappointment to them
Harry guessed, though his vanity suffered by the admission.
He knew now that things must come to a
head between Gabrielle and himself directly he returned
to London, and the very fact kept him in Brighton.
It would have been good to be alone but for
his longing after Maryska. He missed her every minute
of the day&mdash;there was hardly an hour from dawn
to dark when her image did not arise before him and
her black eyes look into his own.</p>

<p class="indent">Brighton had always interested him in the old time,
but he found it insupportably dull during this brief
and almost penitential vacation. His club, one of the
&quot;brainiest&quot; in the country, as he used to boast elsewhere,
was filled by earnest men who could discuss
nothing but the passing of the frost and the danger
which the country had escaped almost miraculously.
Standing upon the breezy front, where a warm south
wind rattled the windows of the old houses, it seemed
impossible to believe that a man might have picked
ice from that very shore but a few short weeks ago.
Now Brighton was as ever a compound of stones and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
stucco; of square lawns and of wide windows as
methodical; of a tumbling sea, and elderly gentlemen
in weird waistcoats to gaze upon it.</p>

<p class="indent">All these had plans for their country&#39;s salvation,
and few of them did not mention the name of John
Faber at some time or other. Harry would sit in the
corner with the old priest, Father Healy, and listen
contemptuously to the talk of one who, as he said,
had earned immortality by cornering the wheat market
and then giving away a few sacks for the sake of
making a splash! When the kindly old priest would
say, &quot;Come, come! he has done very much more than
that,&quot; the good sportsman admitted that perhaps he
had; but he would invariably round it off by saying,
&quot;Well, he&#39;s gone now, anyway!&quot; and would ask upon
that: &quot;What are we going to do to help ourselves;
that&#39;s what I want to know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It opened fine possibilities of debate in which many
joined. The militant section had but one panacea:
&quot;We must prepare for war!&quot; Civilians, equally confident,
harped upon a system of national granaries,
and asked what imbecility of the national intellect had
prevented us building them before? &quot;Provisions
against a siege,&quot; they said.</p>

<p class="indent">The priest was almost alone in desiring that a
siege should be made impossible.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Build granaries of goodwill, as John Faber has
advised you,&quot; he said. &quot;Let the builders be your best
intellects. There is no other surety!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Harry liked the doctrine, but had not the wit to
support it with success. He was constantly depressed,
and even the cheery spirits in the billiard-room could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
do little for him. The futility of his flight and the
cowardice of it became apparent as the days rolled by.
Why had he left London and what was he doing in
this place? Was not Maryska alone, and was she the
one to be left safely to her own devices? He began
to be afraid for her, and to say that he must return.
His courage shrank from the ordeal, but his desire
would face it.</p>

<p class="indent">And that was the state of things when, without
any warning at all, &quot;the little gipsy&quot; came to
Brighton, and, presenting herself immediately at his
rooms, declared with conviction her intention not to
depart therefrom without her lover.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span></p>

<h2><a name="ch4-4" id="ch4-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">SURRENDER AND AFTERWARDS</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">She looked very tired; there were deep black lines
beneath her eyes, and her dress was muddy. Incidentally
she told him that she had walked from the station&mdash;a
feminine coup to deceive possible adversaries, and
one greatly to her liking.</p>

<p class="indent">Harry occupied a bedroom and a sitting-room in
that Boulevard St. Germain of Brighton, Oriental Terrace,
opposite the club. The sitting-room had a window,
from where you could see the pier if your neck
were long enough; the bedroom was dark and gloomy,
and suggestive of the monastic habit. Neither apartment
had any ornament to speak of&mdash;the pictures
wounded the gentlest critic; the chairs were mid-Victorian
and covered in leather. Yet when Maryska
came, he would have sworn that this was a house of
Arcady. One wild question he put to her: one loud
word of remonstrance which brought the tears to her
eyes. Then she was in his arms, her heart beating like
a frightened bird&#39;s, all her nerves quivering when her
lips sought his own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maryska, what have you done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She snatched her hat from her tousled hair, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
threw it on the shabby sofa. Squatting upon the
corner of the table, her luggage in her hand, she
tried to tell as well as laughter and tears would permit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was after breakfast&mdash;Gabrielle had gone down
to the church to see the organist. I ran out with all
my money in my purse, and went round to Holly
Place. She would not tell me where you were until
I frightened her&mdash;<i>Dieu de mon √¢me</i>, what a woman
she was! But I stamped my foot, and I said the
things he used to say, and then she wrote it down
for me. At the bottom of the wide hill I saw the
<i>voiturier</i>, and called him. When I said that it was to
Brighton, he laughed&mdash;the <i>gamin</i> that he was! But
I was angry once more and I got into the carriage,
and I would not get out again. That seemed to please
him. He said that he would vote for women, and he
took me to the <i>gare</i>. I did not know that you must
go by the railway to Brighton, and he laughed when
I asked him&mdash;but the <i>facteur</i> was there, and he said
I was on time. So I came right along&mdash;and <i>ecco</i>, I
am here! Are you glad that is so, <i>b√™te sauvage</i>? Are
you not pleased that I have come to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had not an idea what to say to her. The world
seemed to be turned upside down in an instant. There
was no such town as Brighton in all the kingdom.
How the sun shone into that gloomy room! What
diamonds of light were everywhere! He had come
suddenly to the palace of his dreams and the mistress
of it was here. And yet his talk must be a commonplace.
The whys and wherefores would not
stand aside even in an hour pregnant of such wonders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean to say you bolted, Maryska&mdash;just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
biffed off without a word to anyone? My hat! what
will the Silvesters say? What shall we tell them when
we go back?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She swung a little bonnet by the strings and
shrugged her shoulders determinedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you suppose I am going back to that house?
<i>Jamais de ma vie</i>&mdash;I am here, and I shall stay. If
you do not want me, please say so. I have money and
I shall do very well. It is there, and you can count
it; the American is my friend, and he has given me
money always. So, you see, I do not wish you to work
for me; and when the money is all spent, I will go out
to the caf√©s and they will let me dance. Then we
shall do very well, you and I, Harry, but not in such
an apartment as this. <i>Dio di mi alma!</i> was there ever
so dreadful a lodging? And you have lived here
three whole days as the woman told me! Three days
in such a house&mdash;<i>madre mia</i>, what a life! But now
we shall go away to the hotel until the money is spent.
Say that we shall go, and make me happy, for you
know that I could not live here. Will you not say it,
Harry&mdash;please, at once?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She put her arms about his neck again and kissed
him, while her round eyes looked deeply into his own.
He was her lover, and all her creed, learned in the
nomad&#39;s church, taught her that she was sacred to
him and he to her. Upon his side was the swift
realisation that he must play the game. He would
take her back to London immediately. There was no
alternative.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d say anything I could to please you, Maryska,
but don&#39;t you see that we must think of what other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
people will say? Why, we&#39;re not even engaged, little
Gipsy, and if we went to a hotel together, all the
idiots we know would shout at us. I can&#39;t have that
for your sake. If we were married, it would be different.
Let&#39;s go to London at once, and tell the Silvesters
what we mean to do. Now, don&#39;t you see, it&#39;s
the very best thing we can do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not see, but sat there, a rueful picture,
with fifty golden sovereigns on the table beside her
and all her worldly possessions in a little unopened
parcel. A terrible fear of the return to the gloomy
house in Hampstead consumed her. Her eyes filled
with tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will never go back,&quot; she said coldly; &quot;if you
do not want me, Harry, I will go where no one shall
ever see me again. If you love me, why cannot you
marry me? I am ready to go to the priest this instant.
<i>He</i> said it was all d&mdash;&mdash;d palaver, but I do not refuse
to go because of that. Take me now, and I
will be your little gipsy wife. Do you not wish it,
Harry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Of course he wished it, and yet what should he
say to her? Being a mere man and knowing something
of such a nature as this, her threat had a meaning
he did not dare to ignore. What if she refused
to go to London with him? Would people blame him?
He heard already the horrible malice of those who
would declare that he had decoyed her from her home.
The world, so far as it concerned him, would say
that he was a scoundrel; his whole life had taught
him to care for such censure when the greater issues
were at stake. Oh! she had put him in a pretty fix;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
and yet he loved her and had discovered that he
could not leave her though ten thousand railed upon
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you understand, Gipsy,&quot; he protested in
despair, &quot;these things cannot be done just like that?
I&#39;m going to marry you, and no one alive shall stop
me. But I can&#39;t do it in five minutes. We shall
have to get a licence and swear we&#39;ve lived in Brighton
heaven knows how long. Then there&#39;s the church
people to see&mdash;and, of course, the Silvesters must
know. It would be shabby to keep them in the dark.
My dearest, why do you cry? Don&#39;t you see I can&#39;t
make it different just because I love you? Won&#39;t you
understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up at him through her tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do love me, Harry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;More than anything on earth, little Gipsy. So
help me God! it&#39;s true. I couldn&#39;t leave you now
if I wanted to. Put your arms round my neck and tell
me you believe it. There, just like that&mdash;and don&#39;t
say another word about going away, or I don&#39;t know
what will happen to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He pulled her on to his knees and held her close
to him. She had twenty schemes in her head, but
the one she liked best was the suggestion that her
fifty pounds would bribe the priest to an immediate
ceremony. For herself, the thing was of little account.
<i>He</i> had taught her that it did not matter as long as a
man loved a woman, and beyond that was a knowledge
of the world almost terrible in its savage conceptions
of right and wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In my country,&quot; she said na√Øvely, &quot;we go away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
to the hills when we are in love, and no one thinks
we have done wrong. I have seen dreadful things,
Harry; I saw them at Ranovica when &#39;the boss&#39; went
there with my father. Oh! do not think I am the
simple baby that you English like their wives to be.
The world was very unkind to him and to me. Sometimes,
for many days together we have slept at the
hotel of the Belle √âtoile, and he would sell our clothes
for bread. Once, at Perpignan, we were put in
prison, and I did not see him for a week. It was
there he met a fellow-countryman who bought us from
the judge and took us to Scutari. His relations were
great people, but he would never ask anything of
them, he was too proud. Some day, when you and
I are rich, we will go to Bukharest and tell them who
we are. Perhaps we will walk all the way, as he and
I did from Dijon to N√Æmes, when the money was gone.
Dear heart! what a walk it was, and all the acacias
were blooming and the scent of the hay in the fields
and the white farms at night&mdash;and, yes, the old abb√©
who was so gentle and good. He called me &#39;little
daughter&#39;&mdash;it was near Valence, and I know that if
you and I had gone to him, he would have married
us. Perhaps, if you cannot bribe the priest here, we
will take the steamer and go now. Oh, how good it
will be in the warm hay when the sun shines! And
we could get money at the caf√©s and perhaps in Bukharest;
it would be true what he told me, and his
friends would be a little kind. Will you not take
me, Harry? Shall we not go to the sun together, away
from this dreadful country? Oh, how happy I would
be! How my life would be changed if you would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
go. Dearest, will you not do it when Maryska asks
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She pressed her hot cheek upon his hand and held
his hands as though she never would release them.
If her confessions startled him, he perceived in them
an acquaintanceship with life and its realities far surpassing
his own. He had led a humdrum existence
enough apart from his cricket; but here was one who
could lift the veil of romance as no story-book had
done. The word pictures of the joyous life moved
him strangely by their suggestions of a freedom which
was all-embracing; of a garden of love whereon the
sun would ever shine! And from that, it was like him
to tumble suddenly to realities and to remember the
loaves and the fishes. She must be very hungry, he
thought. What course more obvious than to take her
to the hotel, and to give her some food?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By Jove! I forgot all about it,&quot; he cried, lifting
her on to her feet, and so snatching at her hat. &quot;We&#39;ll
go to the Metropole and have some grub, Gipsy!
Aren&#39;t you hungry, little wild cat? Don&#39;t you think
you could eat me? Come along, then. It will be
time to talk about all this afterwards. We can wire
the Silvesters as we go; let &#39;em do what they like,
Gipsy. I shan&#39;t part with you now; never again, I
swear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head, and was but half satisfied.
The kindly minister of the gospel stood to her for
an ogre who would make light of the Belle √âtoile,
but much of that ancient office beginning with
&quot;Dearly beloved,&quot; and ending with the ecclesiastical
blessing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span></p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">Gordon Silvester was a man who had lived forty-five
years of his life without excitements, and had then
been plunged into them headlong.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a great thing for a man, whose only diversion
hitherto had been the weekly disputations with
the deacons or the quarterly disagreement with the
organist, to find himself suddenly upon public platforms,
cheek by jowl with the great men of the world,
who pleaded for the supreme blessing which could
come upon humanity, the blessing of peace. The
notoriety had fallen to the plodding minister after
many years, and henceforth he had been up to his eyes
in the papers, the pamphlets and other paraphernalia
of the pacific propaganda. The <i>r√©clame</i> of it all delighted
him. He became almost a hustler, and was at
war with every whisper which deplored the ancient
habit and the paths of ease.</p>

<p class="indent">There were many worries, to be sure. Bishops
would send mere archdeacons to his meetings. His
letters to the Press were shockingly mutilated. He
had the suspicion that certain worldly millionaires
merely considered him a pawn in the game, and were
quite unwilling to admit that Hampstead was the hub
of the universe. Upon this, came the gradual conviction
that his daughter, Gabrielle, was the real agent
of much of the fame that he won, and that his meetings
were a success or a failure in just such a measure
as she chose to make them. If this had been the
case before the great tribulation, he found the position
even more intolerable when the danger was past.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
All England spoke now of fact and not of theory.
The demand for brains to save the nation from another
panic was universal. Men said that arbitration had
become as much a necessity as vaccination. You could
not starve thirty-seven millions because the frontier
of a swamp must be delimited or a possible mine
in a bog be possessed! The phantoms of the living
death had hovered over the country during the terrible
weeks and the lesson had been learned. But for that
master-mind&mdash;the mind of the great American, whom
destiny had sent in the critical hour&mdash;the end of all
things had come! It was supererogatory now to
preach mere platitudes from ancient platforms.</p>

<p class="indent">So Silvester fell a little to the background and
suffered an unmerited obscurity. The common ills of
the domestic life cropped up again, and must be doctored.
He had to pay rents, rates and taxes, and to
remember that Gabrielle was about to marry a boy
whose income, at the best, could not be more than
five hundred a year. And she might have done so
well! Some recollection of his old time ambition upon
the steamer filled him with vain regrets now that
John Faber had left England. The compensation was
a cheque for ¬£5,000, to be employed to Maryska&#39;s
benefit until she should set out for New York. Meanwhile
she was to remain at Hampstead to learn all
that Silvester could teach her of the social amenities
and the elemental faith. An unstable patronage, to
be sure, but very characteristic of that restless brain.
Silvester paid the cheque into his bank, and declared
he would do his best. Three days afterward he knew
that he could do nothing at all.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span></p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">Harry sent the telegram from the General Post
Office at Brighton at half-past two exactly. It was
laconic, and evaded the issue somewhat cleverly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maryska is at the Metropole Hotel at Brighton
with me. All well. Return as soon as possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had written it when fortified by the child&#39;s
black eyes, and some excellent Rudesheim she had
insisted upon drinking. It was all up between Gabrielle
and him&mdash;it had been all up long ago, and well enough
for both of them that it should be. She would marry
the American and spend his money like one o&#39;clock!
Harry was sure of this, though he had some qualms
when he remembered that Faber had sailed from
Southampton and intimated very plainly that the date
of his return was distant.</p>

<p class="indent">It was wonderful how frankly he and Maryska
discussed this very matter. The daughter of Louis
de Paleologue knew little of the sacrament of marriage
but a great deal of the sociology of the studio.
Her doctrine recognised the passion and the pathos
of love, but the bonds it inspired were personal, and
had little to do with the priest. If a man did not love
a woman, he left her and sought another. There were
neither scenes nor scruples. Sometimes the woman
would rage fearfully for a day, but her anger soon
passed and calm fell. In this case she did not think
there would be any anger, and she was right. There
was merely humiliation.</p>

<p class="indent">Verily a heavy blow fell upon that little house in
Hampstead when the telegram came. It was so like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
Gordon Silvester with his large faith in human nature,
and his habit of making a fetish of a public
school education; so like him to believe it all mere
high spirits and to declare that the pair of them
would be home to dinner. Gabrielle knew the truth
from that moment. The ship that drifted upon the
ocean of a &quot;boy and girl&quot; infatuation had come to
harbour. She would not hide it either from her father
or herself, whatever the cost to her pride.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expected nothing less!&quot; she said to Silvester,
when he ran into her boudoir with the telegram and
tried to make a jest of it. &quot;It was in the child&#39;s
blood. We cannot be responsible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester threw himself into an arm-chair, and began
to swing a leg as was his habit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Responsible for what? Don&#39;t you see it&#39;s a childish
freak? Of course, they ought not to have done
it. I must cut down all this liberty now that Faber
has gone. She&#39;s to give me an account of her day,
and no going out at all unless you or I know. Really,
it&#39;s too bad of Harry!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gabrielle went to the window, still holding the
telegram in her hand. Her lips quivered, but she
spoke apparently without emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At least, he will behave honourably,&quot; she said. &quot;I
have no fear upon that point. He will marry her at
once, father; he cannot do less.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silvester laid back his head upon the cushion and
surveyed a ceiling not ill-painted by a one-time zealous
amateur.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marriage is a great institution, my dear; I don&#39;t
find it a fitting subject for jest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
&quot;Oh, my God!&quot; she said, wheeling about and facing
him so suddenly that he sat bolt upright. &quot;Don&#39;t
you see what it means? Has it not been going on
under our very eyes? And you talk of a &#39;boy and girl&#39;
escapade! I tell you they are madly in love. She
sees no one else when he is there&mdash;he cannot take his
eyes off her. Why, they are married already for all
I know&mdash;or you care,&quot; she added with almost savage
emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">The outburst frightened a man by no means blessed
with much pluck where women were concerned. Silvester
turned as white as a sheet. It was as though
a pit had been opened at his feet, and he had looked
in to see enormities.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t mean to tell me&mdash;God forbid!&quot; he
gasped. &quot;You don&#39;t mean to tell me that this is sin,
Gabrielle? You don&#39;t think that, surely?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what to think,&quot; she said in despair.
&quot;It is our business to act at once. You must go to
Brighton. What will Mr. Faber say if you don&#39;t?
Telegraph to Southampton in case the yacht has not
sailed. Have we no responsibilities? Oh! don&#39;t you
see? It&#39;s madness, madness! And it&#39;s our fault.
Both of us are to blame. We have just gone our own
ways and left them to themselves. What else could
have come of it when they were lovers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stood before her utterly abashed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dearest girl,&quot; he said, &quot;I will go to Brighton
at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it&#39;s of you I should be thinking. God bless
you, Gabrielle!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span></p>

<p class="center">IV</p>

<p class="indent">He left by the half-past four o&#39;clock train from
Victoria, and did not return that night. When he
was gone, Gabrielle shut herself up in her own room,
and asked herself what new thing had come into her
life.</p>

<p class="indent">A turn of fortune had cast her down from the
heights to the old abyss of the suburban monotonies;
and now it had put this affront upon her. She perceived
already what sport the teacup brigade would
make of it, and how her pride must suffer just because
of the very littleness of her surroundings. All Hampstead
would point the finger at her, and there would
be kind friends in abundance to offer their sympathies.
Thus had her destiny punished the brief hours of an
infatuation for which her youth had been responsible.
As others, she had known a day when she had desired
the love of man and had desired it passionately.
Thus had she come to be the betrothed of one who
had never loved her, and for this she must repay.</p>

<p class="indent">She had thrown aside much, to be sure, to fall
upon such a penalty. John Faber would have made
her his wife could she have escaped the meshes of a
net she herself had tied. He would have lifted her
above all these sordid creeds of a puny society to
the heights of freedom and of opportunity. She believed
that she could have risen with him and upheld
a position his money would have won for them. She
saw herself the mistress of a splendid house; heard her
name in high places; believed that she was born to
rule and not to serve. And opportunity had passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
her by for this. The man who would have ennobled
her had sailed for America, and she did not believe he
would return. In any case, she did not dare to think
of him now. As she had sown, so must she reap.</p>

<p class="indent">Something of an intolerable despair afflicted her
now, and drove her to silent tears. The stillness of
the house, the measured chiming of the church bells,
the monotonous fall of footsteps upon the pavement,
how they all suggested the round of the insufferable
days she must live! It had been so different a month
ago, when her name had been honoured and her activities
abundant. How full her life had been then, when
many had honoured her, and she had gone proudly
in and out among the people. Such an opportunity
could not recur; and she reflected that it had been
made for her by one who had been willing that she
should wear the laurel his brains had won. He was on
the Atlantic now, and all must seem but an episode
in his story.</p>

<p class="indent">Here, perchance, she did herself less than justice;
for her aims had been noble and her faith quite honest.
She had desired the supreme gift of peace upon earth,
and much that she had done was the fruit of an enthusiasm
which had brought this very shame upon her.
She would not think of it now nor remember her sacrifice.
Enough to say that the night of her hopes had
come down, and that the day would never dawn again.</p>

<p class="indent">So the long hours passed wearily. At eight o&#39;clock
there came a telegram from her father in vague terms,
but such as she had expected:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am doing all possible. Everything will be well.
Shall not return yet. Writing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
She crumpled the paper in her hand and fell to
wondering what the message meant. Had Silvester
discovered such an escapade as his faith discerned or
something of which he would not speak? She knew
not what to think, but remembered her last words to
him, that he should telegraph to John Faber in case
the yacht had not sailed.</p>

<p class="indent">In case it had not sailed!</p>

<p class="indent">Her face flushed and her heart beat faster when
she repeated the words.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet, God knows, it could matter little to her
whether the <i>Savannah</i> was still in Southampton Water
or had passed the Lizard Light upon its way to the
great Atlantic.</p>

<p class="center">V</p>

<p class="indent">The lunch at the Metropole was altogether different
from any lunch Harry had eaten in all his life. It was
as though something had transformed Brighton in a
twinkling, making of its commonplaces a paradise, and
melting its shadows in a rain of gold. Never had he
realised what a town it was: how bright, how inspiring,
and how typical of a joyous life. And this is to
say that a pride of possession had come upon him so
that he walked proudly by Maryska&#39;s side&mdash;he who
had known hundreds of pretty girls, and had flirted
with many of them. Now the recklessness of a young
passion took charge of the situation, and would not
be denied. The tears had passed from the child&#39;s face,
and the sun shone down upon them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall go to Paris to-night,&quot; she said triumphantly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
&quot;and afterwards to Italy. <i>Bien entendu</i>, you
do not wish to tease me any more, Harry. It is all
over, is it not&mdash;this gloomy England and all the sad
people? I shall never see them any more, shall I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed loudly, so that many in the room turned
their heads to look at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Maryska,&quot; he rejoined, &quot;we&#39;re not married
yet, my dear. How can I take you to Italy when we
are not married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thought upon this, her pretty head poised upon
her hand. For herself that would have been no obstacle
at all, for had not <i>he</i> said that marriage was
something which the priests did to keep the wolf from
the door? Harry, however, must be considered, and
for his sake she would think about it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall pay the priest and he will marry us,&quot;
she said at length. &quot;Show him the money and he will
not turn us away. It is not necessary to show him
too much at the commencement. Afterwards you can
put more upon the table, and he will see it. That
is what my father did when his friend, the Abb√© of
Dijon, wished that I should be confirmed. He wanted
to paint a picture in the church there, and he said that
it did not matter a damn one way or the other. So,
you see, it can be done, Harry; and what you can do
in Dijon, you can do in England. Go to the priest
and learn if I am not wise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; he cried, laughing as he raised his glass,
&quot;you are the last word in originals, and that&#39;s sure!
Don&#39;t you know that there are twenty things to be
done before people can be married in England? It&#39;s
almost easier to get hanged. No priest would marry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
us unless he had a license, Maryska. I suppose I can
get a special in two or three days, but we shall want
all that. Meanwhile, had you not really better go
back to Hampstead?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her spirits fell. The rose-bud of a mouth drooped
pathetically. She did not believe a word of it, and
was driven to the thought that he renounced her after
all! Thus she came upon the borderland of a scene
even in the dining-room of the great hotel, while he
shrank in despair from the task of persuading her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will never go back to Hampstead; I will throw
myself into the sea first!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t talk rot, Maryska. You know I want to
do the best I can for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it the best to send me away when I love you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not sending you away; I&#39;m only keeping you
out of the reach of silly tongues.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do I care for them? What does it all matter
if we love?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It won&#39;t matter for more than two or three days.
After that, we&#39;ll go to Italy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I shall stay in Brighton by your side until
the permit arrives. I will never go to Hampstead
again, so help me God!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but you mustn&#39;t swear! Let&#39;s talk about it
after lunch, dearest girl. I want just to look at you
and see you happy. Do you know you&#39;re frightfully
pretty, Maryska?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She flushed with pleasure upon that. Many a man
had called her pretty in the old days; but she shrank
from their words then, knowing well what they meant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>He</i> used to say that it would be so, if ever I loved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
a man. I have been so lonely since he died, and that
has made my face sad. Now it is different. I do not
mean to be sad any more. I shall go to Italy, and we
will laugh in the sun together. Cannot it be to-day,
Harry? Here is the sea, and there are the ships. Let
us take one and sail away! We can think of the priest
in France, where there are many who will be glad of
our money. Will you not please me, <i>sauvage b√™te</i>?
Then take me upon the ship immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He could not answer it. The problem became more
embarrassing every hour, and when lunch was done,
and they were out on the parade together, it began to
seem beyond his wit altogether. Not for a kingdom
would he have brought tears to those bright eyes again.
How prettily she babbled at his side; how quick, how
clever, how beautiful she was! A pride of possession
prevailed above all prudence, and drove him far from
considered resolutions. He was content to go, hand
in hand with her&mdash;God knew whither!</p>

<p class="indent">In the end, it all came back to the priest. Let
them see the priest! He knew but one priest in
Brighton, and that was the excellent Father Healy,
with whom he had fraternised at his club. Divine
inspiration. Let them call upon him.</p>

<p class="center">VI</p>

<p class="indent">Father Maurice Healy lived up at the back of the
town in an old windmill, skilfully transformed and
built about so that it had become a veritable bungalow,
with more than one pleasant room and a little chapel
which his lady friends declared was too divine for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
words. He had been smoking his afternoon cigar,
when the amazing pair burst in upon him, and never
in all his life had he laid down good tobacco to listen
to a tale so wonderful!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye&#39;ll have to wait,&quot; he said dryly. &quot;I&#39;ve no
power to marry ye at all as the State understands the
term. Ye&#39;ll get a special licence, and then come to
me. &#39;Tis wise advice, my dear, that ye should go
back to your friends in London until things can be
put straight. Make up your mind to that. I&#39;m no
better off in securing you to legal marriage than any
man ye may stop in the street. Mr. Lassett knows
that well, and he&#39;ll have told ye as much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Harry nodded his head in unison with the words
as though this was just the counsel he had expected.
Maryska, thinking that she knew priests well, clasped
her precious bag firmly in both her little hands and
looked the enemy squarely in the face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will pay you money,&quot; she said with much
dignity. &quot;I have ten pounds here, and you shall
have it. What you say does not matter to us at all.
We are not frightened of the judges, Harry and I.
If you marry us to-day, we shall go away to Italy,
and the gendarmes will not find us. He has said
that I must go back to Hampstead, but I will never
do so. I will kill myself if you do not marry us.
Harry knows that it is true, and that is why we have
come here. Perhaps, if you married us, he has some
money and will add it to mine. There are other
priests, but we do not wish to go to them. Oh, sir,
will you not do it for those who love? Will you not
make us happy? It is nothing to me this ceremony,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
but to him it is so much. And I have the money here;
I will show it to you if you wish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She began to fumble with the bag while the good
father and Harry regarded her with an amazement beyond
all words. Never had Maurice Healy heard such
an address or seen so pretty a bargainer in that little
room. And the horror of it all&mdash;her ignorance, her
childish faith, her frank confession! He was as clay
in her hands already&mdash;and she, a heathen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, my dear young lady, &#39;tis far from understanding
ye are,&quot; he gasped at length; &quot;not a penny of
your money would I be touching anyway. Don&#39;t you
see I can&#39;t marry ye because the law will not let me?
&#39;Tis not me, but the Parliament that has the making
of it. Ye must take your money to them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska looked at him almost with pity. Harry&#39;s
appeal to her might as well have been addressed to
the stucco walls of the bungalow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not believe you,&quot; she said; &quot;you have a
little church there, and you can say the words. The
money will buy you many things that this poor house
is in need of. Please to marry us at once, and then
we can go and be happy. Oh, sir, if you knew what
it was to love! But priests do not know that; they
have no hearts. You will let us sail to Italy without
your blessing, and will remember it afterwards. Is
it kind of you to do that when you think that you
serve God?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, my child, I will give ye my blessing freely;
&#39;tis to marry you I am unable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We do not care for that; nothing matters to us
but our love. We go to Italy to forget this dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
country and its people. If you will not do as we
wish, we shall ask no other. Is it for religion to refuse
us, father, when we have come here as the Church
would wish us to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God be good to me!&quot; he cried in despair, &quot;but
I don&#39;t know what to say to you, and that&#39;s the truth.
I&#39;ll see your husband, my dear, and have a talk to
him. Will you come into the dining-room while I
have a word with ye, Mr. Lassett? &#39;Tis beyond all
argument and reason&mdash;God knows it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not demur, and they went away, leaving
her before a superb crucifix, which seemed to speak of
the country for which she sighed. The argument between
the good father and the equally good sportsman
was both long and at times explosive. &quot;Nothing
easier,&quot; said the priest, &quot;than to take her back to London
and be married in three days&#39; time.&quot; &quot;Nothing
more impossible to do any such thing,&quot; urged Master
Harry, who thought that he knew the patient. She
would never go to London, and if she were left alone
in an hotel at Brighton, he would not answer for her.
Had she been an Englishwoman, the whole situation
would have been impossible. But she was just a waif
and stray from the wilds of Bohemia, and her creed
had been learned under the kindly stars. Would
Father Healy take charge of her until a licence could
be got? The father said &quot;No,&quot; most emphatically;
he would have no woman in the house. What, then,
did he suggest?</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, they were both very frightened of her,
and they spoke in low tones as though she might
burst in and accuse them. Impossible to face that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
little fury and declare, &quot;There is nothing to be done.&quot;
When Harry suggested that common humanity would
marry them and trust to the licence afterwards, Father
Healy asked, &quot;Would ye have me in prison?&quot; None
the less, both plainly perceived now that it must be
done. A licence could be obtained immediately, and
the civil marriage celebrated at the office of the registrar.
The good father, vague about the law, followed
Harry back to the room with a protest on his lips. It
was none of his doing&mdash;and yet he did it after all.
And Harry must swear solemnly, and she must follow
with her pledged word, not to leave Brighton until
the affair was made legal. Oh, the change in her
when she knew the truth!</p>

<p class="indent">So they got the priest&#39;s blessing before the little
altar in the oratory, and when the brief ceremony
was over, they went away together, back to his rooms.
But they were no longer gloomy rooms, for now the
two saw nothing but each other&#39;s eyes, and little it
mattered to them that the oleographs were mid-Victorian
and that the mahogany chairs matched them.
Maryska had found the heart of a new world, and she
dwelt there for just two hours in good content until
there came a knock upon the door, and Gordon Silvester,
tired, pale, and wonderfully earnest, entered
softly into their paradise and began to speak of men
and cities.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have telegraphed to Mr. Faber,&quot; he said. &quot;He
must know immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska laughed in his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is on the sea,&quot; she said. &quot;You will have to
send the telegram which flies.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span></p>

<h2><a name="ch4-5" id="ch4-5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">TWO SHIPS UPON THE SEA</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="indent">Faber had expected such a telegram; but he had
not thought that it would be so longed delayed.</p>

<p class="indent">He told Gabrielle once upon a time that she was
drifting upon a tide which would carry her to unhappy
seas; but he himself had been doing the same thing
since his work in England was finished. This was a
man who had learned to love a woman, but was a very
novice, none the less, in all the arts of love.</p>

<p class="indent">Had it been a business affair, with what zeal would
he not have plunged into it? Being far from that, a
situation in which the whole soul of the man was at
stake, he did as the woman had done&mdash;drifted upon
the tide of circumstance, and was content to wait.</p>

<p class="indent">Be sure that he had read the secret of Harry Lassett&#39;s
passion for Maryska almost at the beginning.
Because of it, he left her in the little house at Hampstead,
and would have sailed to New York without
her. If Harry had the courage, he would cut the knot,
and the treasure ship would float upon a kindly stream
to the harbour already prepared. But would he have
the courage? One excuse and another kept Faber at
Southampton, but the news did not come. The order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
to weigh anchor had been given, and recalled a dozen
times in as many days. The yacht would have been
in the Solent that very night, but for Gabrielle&#39;s instructions
to her father. &quot;Telegraph Mr. Faber,&quot; she
had said. He received the message while he was writing
to Sir Jules Achon in the little cabin which served
him for library, and there being no train to serve his
purpose, the fastest motor-car in Southampton was on
the road to Brighton within the hour.</p>

<p class="indent">It was half-past eleven when he reached Oriental
Terrace, and five minutes later when he burst in upon
a dismal company. Having taken possession of &quot;the
assets of respectability,&quot; Gordon Silvester had refused
to budge an inch; and having exhausted his homilies
upon &quot;honour,&quot; &quot;the married state,&quot; and the &quot;scandal
of the whole proceeding,&quot; had fallen to a sullen silence.
Harry and Maryska, no less obstinate, declared
their intention of remaining in Brighton until a registrar
had married them, and then of leaving for Paris
immediately. An appeal to the girl to consider her
obligations toward John Faber met with the characteristic
answer that she recognised none. She was
sorry for this a little later on when Faber himself appeared
just like a fairy godfather to a scowling Cinderella.
His coming gratified her vanity; his dominant
will never failed to subdue her. She remembered
the hours they had spent together upon the road to
Ranovica and all they had meant to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, little girl, and what has been going on here,
now&mdash;and Mr. Lassett, too? I guess I&#39;m on time for
the party anyway. Will someone just tell me what it&#39;s
all about before we begin? Don&#39;t move, Mr. Silvester.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
I&#39;d have you all be comfortable and I&#39;ll light a cigar
if Miss Maryska doesn&#39;t mind. Now, will no one tell
me the story?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maryska ran to him just like a child to a father.
He was plump in an arm-chair with her by his side
before a man could have counted ten, and she lit his
cigar with a little hand which trembled while it held
the match.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Harry and I are married!&quot; she said, &quot;you must
not be very cross; <i>he</i> would not have been. We went
to the priest this afternoon&mdash;then that man came, and
will not go away! Will you send him away, please?
We do not want him here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even Silvester laughed at this; all the conventions
went into the melting-pot at the bidding of the child.
It would have been impossible for Melpomene herself
to have resisted her. The minister puffed hard at his
pipe, and forgot her ingratitude. John Faber stroked
her hair, and said to himself that her love had changed
her wonderfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, my dear, that&#39;s not very kind to your good
friend nor to me!&quot; he said gently enough. &quot;Don&#39;t
you think you might have told us something about it
all? Perhaps we should have been able to help you
if you had come to us. Was it right to keep us all in
the dark like this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, Harry blurted out that it was all his
fault, and that she was not to blame. There were
three speaking at once presently, and all the while
Faber had Maryska&#39;s arms about his neck. They had
not meant to do it all&mdash;circumstances drove them;
they thought that he had gone away. To which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
added the truly feminine dictum that they could not
help loving each other, and were not to blame. When
Silvester obtained a grasp of the situation, and declared
that she must have known she was doing wrong,
Maryska responded that she did not care a d&mdash;&mdash;n;
which finished the worthy pastor, and sent him in
high dudgeon back to his hotel. It was nearly midnight,
and he feared that he would be locked out!</p>

<p class="indent">When he was gone, Faber took Harry aside and
had a long talk with him. This was a very different
affair, and set every nerve in the young man&#39;s body
tingling. To begin with, there was the charge upon
the honour of the man. Why had he not had it out
with Gabrielle? A man who cannot talk straight to a
woman, whatever the circumstances, is worth very
little in the world. Then, what did he propose to
do? To keep house and wife and children upon his
paltry three hundred a year? What selfishness was
that; what a confession of idleness and vain folly!
He, Faber, would let Maryska remain with no man
who would not work himself for her, and bring ambition
to his task. Harry should have twelve months to
justify himself! If he needed capital, it was there&mdash;but
he must prove his worth. &quot;Show me,&quot; said Faber,
&quot;that you earn five hundred pounds honestly at the
end of twelve months, and I will make it five thousand!&quot;
Failing that, he swore very solemnly that he
would have Maryska back with him at Charleston,
and defy the consequences. &quot;She&#39;ll be glad to come,&quot;
he said; &quot;she&#39;s just the kind to discover whether a
man has grit in him or no&mdash;and God help you, if you
haven&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
To the little wife, his farewell was in a kindlier
mood altogether. She must know that she had a
friend in him always; send for him whenever she was
in trouble. He would try to cross the Atlantic to see
her sometimes; the years were speeding, and he did
not mean to work as hard as he had done. He would
have her always in his thoughts, his fellow traveller
upon the drear road of death. The present that he
gave her brought the hot blush to her cheeks. Oh,
the days of joy it would buy in the south, where the
sun would shine upon her life. She kissed him again
and again. &quot;<i>He</i> will know that you have made me
happy,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">He saw her last through the uncurtained window,
showing her treasure to Harry. The boy drew her
close and kissed her. They were alone at last.</p>

<p class="indent">But John Faber returned immediately to Southampton,
through a sleeping country for which his
genius had done much in the days of tribulation.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Jules Achon&#39;s yacht was in dock when Faber
awoke late next day, and he learned with some surprise
that it had reached the Solent yesterday, and was
anchored a little while in Portsmouth harbour, until,
indeed, Rupert Trevelle went aboard with news of
the <i>Savannah</i>. Then Sir Jules sailed for Southampton
immediately, and so the master minds met at last,
each with his own story of the tremendous days.
Faber thought the baronet a little worn by his labours;
but his zeal was unchanged, and he still looked toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
that goal of life where the peace of the world should
be won. The Tsar, he said, was still unwilling to
come in; but he had obtained much encouragement
at the minor courts, especially those of the south-east
of Europe. For England herself, he had little hope
in the matter. The old imagination had failed his
countrymen. The petty issues, not the greater, were
discussed in the market place.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This should be a story of three kings,&quot; he said,
&quot;and they must recreate the world. In your country,
you have built an altar to humanity which never can
be cast down. We learn slowly in Europe, for we
are blinded by the glitter of ancient arms. In more
material things, the shopkeeping instinct is the foe
of progress. When I can throw down the commercial
barriers, I can cast out war. The field is mighty, but
the labourers are few. If I were not already in my
sixty-fourth year, I would hope to see the noblest
day in the story of man. As it is, I can but sow
and leave those who come after me to reap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Faber said that none of them could hope to do
more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are up against the animal instinct, and that
is as old as Eden. You know my view. If peace is
to be won for humanity, it will be by the brains
and the money of those who lead humanity. This
country has had a terrible fight, and everyone is crying
out for this or that to be done. I shouldn&#39;t wonder
if it all ended in nothing being done. Men talk
the old platitudes the while they read their newspapers
and ask what Germany or Spain has the intention of
doing. I don&#39;t blame the war party, for it is its business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
to make war. God knows, I&#39;ve seen enough of
that to last me a lifetime, and when I go back to
New York, it will be to live on the hill-top. But
others will carry on my business, and it will have to
be carried on. The day when any European nation
disarmed for reasons of sentimentality would be the
last day of its freedom. We must deal with facts as
they are; we cannot run ahead of the great company
of men, for assuredly we shall fall if we do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Jules was in accord with all this. He spoke
fervently of what the big men were doing. Andrew
Carnegie and Taft and Bryce at Washington. An
atmosphere was being created, but he feared its artificiality.
Commerce was the key, he repeated; remove
the commercial bias and the day was won. For
Faber&#39;s promise to become one of the presidents of
the Federation League, he was very grateful. &quot;You
have done much for this country,&quot; he said; &quot;your
name will mean a great deal to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They fell afterwards to talking of their more domestic
affairs. Sir Jules said that his daughter Eva
had gone to Winchester to lunch with a friend, but
he expected her to dinner. The same hesitation which
had led Faber to defer his departure upon so many
recent occasions, now prompted his acceptance of the
suggestion that he should join the party, and he went
over to the <i>Savannah</i> immediately to dress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll weigh to-morrow anyway,&quot; was his word at
parting. &quot;My skipper doesn&#39;t like these waters in
the dark, and I&#39;ve got to consider him. Eight o&#39;clock,
I think you said, Sir Jules? You&#39;ll be alone, of
course?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
&quot;My daughter and I; it will be a pleasure to both
of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="indent">The night fell warm and murky with a soft and
southerly breeze.</p>

<p class="indent">All the lanterns of the ships in Southampton Water
shone clear and steady as Faber paced the quarter-deck
of the <i>Savannah</i> until it should be time to keep
his appointment.</p>

<p class="indent">A month ago how different the scene had been&mdash;the
frost everywhere; the frightened people; the
menace of a peril from which the bravest shrank.
Now this had become a scene of England&#39;s maritime
habit&mdash;a scene wherein the great steamers moved majestically,
their sirens hooting, their crews to be welcomed
home or bidden God-speed, as the occasion
demanded. In the background were the red and green
lamps of the railway, the busy streets of the town, the
coming and going of citizens whose day&#39;s work was
done. As a tempest drifting, the storm had passed.
The ramparts beloved of the nation had made of this
again an island kingdom.</p>

<p class="indent">John Faber dwelt upon such thoughts for an instant,
but anon they turned to a woman. Would he
leave England and seek no more to reason with Gabrielle
Silvester? Would he be justified in going to
her in an hour of some humiliation? He had no young
man&#39;s impetuosity, no virile passion of love which
would break all barriers rudely. A real and generous
sentiment toward her, the belief that she was for him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
the one woman in all the world had become a habit
of his life. She would be the ornament of any man&#39;s
home. Her dignity, her wit, her womanliness&mdash;in
what precious jewels would he not set them if she
had but come to him? And all this might have been
if Harry Lassett had had the courage to tell her the
truth and the little witch of Ragusa had been as other
women. Now, all had been put to the hazard. It
might be that all was lost.</p>

<p class="indent">The boat came alongside at last, and he went aboard.
It was very silent all about him, and when he heard
a woman&#39;s laugh, coming from the deck of a ship, he
wondered that it should seem to speak to him across
the waters. The <i>Savannah</i> herself lay warped to the
quay of the dock, but they put a ladder down for him,
and he climbed it slowly. A steward said that Miss
Achon was in the boudoir, and he went there&mdash;to see
neither Sir Jules nor his daughter, but another figure
and one whose wide eyes expressed all the hope and the
fear of that tremendous encounter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But,&quot; cried Gabrielle, &quot;Eva told me that you had
sailed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; he said, refusing to release her hand, &quot;she&#39;s
not the first of your sex who always tells the truth.&quot;</p>
